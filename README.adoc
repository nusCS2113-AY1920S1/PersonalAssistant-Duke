* OwlMoney is a finance tracker desktop application. It has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) but most of the user
interaction happens in the Command Line Interface (CLI).

* OwlMoney is designed to help undergraduates and fresh graduates track and manage their finanaces.

* OwlMoney is optimized for those who prefer using a CLI. The commands used to interact with the application
are designed to be simple and intuitive, so even those who are unfamiliar with CLI can use OwlMoney with ease.

* OwlMoney allows users to:
** track their finances quickly and more conveniently.
** track their finances in different currencies. _(coming soon)_
** provide an informed decision so that the user is able to decide how much to spend and save.
