* This is a desktop application for managing theatre bookings and finances. A GUI is made but the main user input is done using the Command Line Interface (CLI).
* The GUI shown is still in the early phases and is currently being modified for better quality.
* This application is made to simulate bookings of theatres and its seats done by theatre managers and is not for actual use.
