=== Introducing the Interface

.Main window of Email Manager
image::annotatedUI.png[Main Window, 800]

As shown in Figure 2, the main window of Email Manager has three sections.

* On the left, it is the command interface, where you should be entering your command and get response from
the Email Manager.
* In the middle, it is the task list, which displays all tasks information.
* On the right, it is the email list and content display. You can press `Esc` key on your keyboard any time
to switch display between the list and content view of emails.

=== Try It Out!
Now that you understand the app’s interface, you can now try keying in commands to interact with Email Manager. +
Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. +
All commands have a prefix, indicating whether the command belongs to the `Email` Mode or the `Task`
Mode. The default prefix is `Email` and you can always enter a `flip` command to toggle between `Email`
and `Task`. +
e.g. typing help and pressing Enter opens the help window. +
Some example commands you can try in task mode:

* `list`: lists all tasks
* `deadline submit report -time 12/12/2019 2359`: adds a deadline task named submit report to your task list
* `event meeting -time 10/09/2019 1200 -tag work`:  adds an event task named meeting to your task list.

Some example commands you can try in email mode:

* `list`: lists all the emails
* `show 3`: shows the 3rd email shown in the email list

Some example commands you can try in both modes:

* `flip`: toggle between email and task command
* `bye` : exits the app
Refer to Features for details of each command.

== Features

This section tells you about the features available in Email Manager and how to use them.

Command Format

* The main command is in lowercase.
* User data is in UPPERCASE, which are parameters to be inputted by the user.
e.g. if the command states -time TIME, TIME is a parameter which can be used as -time 12/12/2019 1200.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
e.g. -time TIME [-tag TAG] can be used as -time 12/12/2019 1200 -tag urgent or as -time 12/12/2019 1200.

==== Add Tasks Commands
The following commands in this section allows you to add tasks to Email Manager. They will appear in the centre pane.

[NOTE]
To help you be more organised, each task is able to contain optional parameters.
These parameters are a 'doafter' task, a priority level and multiple tags.
To learn more about these parameters, go to their respective sections:
<<doafter>>, <<priority>>.

[TIP]
For the following commands, you are able to enter the optional parameters in any order
as long as they are entered after the compulsory parameters.

===== Adding a todo: `todo`
Format: `todo TASK_NAME [-doafter DOAFTER_TASK][-priority PRIORITY_LEVEL][-tag TAG1]...`

Adds a task of todo type.

Examples:

`todo buy milk`

`todo take cat to vet -priority High -tag pet`

`todo coding -doafter math -priority high -tag fun`

[TIP]
Parameters other than item number can be entered in any order.

[NOTE]
PRIORITY_LEVEL is restricted to *high*, *med*, *low*. Any other PRIORITY_LEVEL will be invalid.

===== Adding an deadline: `deadline`
Format: `deadline TASK_NAME -time dd/mm/yyyy hhMM [-doafter DOAFTER_TASK][-priority PRIORITY_LEVEL][-tag TAG1]...`

Adds a task that has a deadline. The task name and deadline are required.
A doafter task, priority level or any number of tags are all optional.
Order of the modifiers do not matter.

Examples:

`deadline categorise -time 31/11/2019 2359`

`deadline submission -time 31/10/2019 2359 -doafter coding -priority high -tag fun`

`deadline submission -time Thu 2359`

[TIP]
Parameters other than item number can be entered in any order. +
Natural date format can be used instead of ISO date format.

[NOTE]
Valid ISO date format is in the form of `dd/mm/yyyy hhMM`, input such as `dd/m/yyyy hhMM` for example
`1/3/2019` is invalid.

[NOTE]
PRIORITY_LEVEL is restricted to *high*, *med*, *low*. Any other PRIORITY_LEVEL will be invalid.

[NOTE]
Deadline with time prior to the current time is allowed to be added, but will be marked as *Overdue*.

===== Adding an event: `event`
Format: `event TASK_NAME -time dd/mm/yyyy hhMM [-doafter DOAFTER_TASK][-priority PRIORITY_LEVEL][-tag TAG1]...`

Adds a task of event type.

Example:

`event PE -time 31/10/2019 2359 -doafter coding -priority high -tag fun`

`event PE -time Thu 2359`

`delete 1`

==== Find task(s) with keyword: `find`
Format: `find KEYWORD`

Returns a list of items that contains KEYWORD. This feature will search through the displayed string of
the task including all the attributes and signifier. (Case insensitive) +

Example:
`find cat` will return `cat`, `tabby #cat`, `SoCcat`, `concatenation`

[TIP]
`find` command has a lot of flexibility in usage. If the user wants to find all deadlines, they can search
using `find by:` since all deadlines will contain a `by:` as shown in the list. This is also applicable to
keywords like `Overdue` and `Past`.

==== Done a task: `done`
Format: `done ITEM_NUMBER`

Examples:

`doafter 2 -msg work on project`

`doafter 5 -msg homework`

[NOTE]
Only one 'doafter' task can be added. If you execute another valid `doafter` command
for the same task, it will overwrite any existing 'doafter' task.

[TIP]
You can change or add multiple parameters for a single task in one command using the `update` command.
To learn more, go to <<update>>.

[[priority]]
==== Set Priority Command: `set`
Format: `set ITEM_NUMBER -priority PRIORITY`

Sets a priority to a task.

Examples:

`set 2 -priority med`

[NOTE]
The PRIORITY input is restricted to only *high*, *medium/med* or *low* (case insensitive).
Any other PRIORITY inputted will be invalid.

[WARNING]
This command can override the priority set to a task by the command `update ITEM_NUMBER -priority PRIORITY`
and vice versa. It also overrides the priority set to a task by the `todo`, `deadline` or `event` command,
but not the other way round.

==== Snooze a task: `snooze`
Format: `snooze ITEM_NUMBER [-by NO_OF_DAYS]`

Snoozes the task by the NO_OF_DAYS.

Examples:

`snooze 3`

For example, `deadline 123 -time 11/11/2020 1100 -tag CS` and `deadline 123 -tag CS
-time 11/11/2020 1100` are both valid, but `deadline -time 11/11/2020 1100 123 -tag CS` is not.

[NOTE]
If there are more than one `time`, `doafter` or `priority` parameters, only the last one will be valid.

[WARNING]
Any tags in the command will overwrite *all* current tags in the task

==== Linking tasks to emails: `link`
Format: `link ITEM_NUMBER [-email EMAIL_NUMBER]...`

Notes which email is related to the task specified. If there is no email parameter,
the command will return a list of the emails linked to the task.

|===

==== Clear task list: `clear`
Format: `clear`

This command deletes all tasks in the list.

[WARNING]
Once executed, you will not be able to undo this command.

[TIP]
If you execute this command by accident, you may return to your last saved state
by closing _Email Manager_ without using the `bye` command.

==== Detect Anomalies (coming in v2.0)

=== Email Mode

[NOTE]
To enter email commands, please ensure you are in email mode. If not, see <<changeMode, Section 4.1.2>> for change mode
command using `flip`.

==== Listing all emails: `list`
Format: `list`

Gives a complete list of emails.

==== Showing an email: `show`
Format: `show INDEX_NUMBER`

Show the email content of the email at the index number in the email list.

Example:

`show 3`: shows content of the 3rd email in the email list.

[TIP]
You can press `Esc` key on your keyboard any time to switch display between the list and content view of emails.

==== Fetching emails from server: `fetch`
Format: `fetch`

Fetches email from Outlook.com.

[WARNING]
The window might freeze for a while as it is fetching and parsing emails. Please wait patiently.

==== Fuzzy search on emails
Format: `fuzzySearch TARGET`

This feature searches for the target string across all emails including their subject, sender and body,
with some tolerance of difference. This tolerance is represented by the **edit distance** between two words.
For more details about the **edit distance**, you can find more details
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance[here]. The lower the **edit distance** is, the more similar are
these two strings. This helps you to search through the emails even if you made some typos or when you are
not sure about some names.

This fuzzy search functionality tolerates up to an **edit distance** of 2 and is insensitive to cases. This
means "CS2102" will match to "CS2100" and "S210" but not "CS2211".

It will list all the emails which contain words that match the target string in their subject, sender or
body. Emails are listed in descending order of a **relevance score**. The general idea is, the higher the
score, the more relevant is the email. Lower **edit distance**, more occurrence, or occurrence in subject
and sender will all
contribute to a higher **relevance score**.

[NOTE]
For performance reasons, fuzzy search will only be done word by word. For example, if "project demo" is to
be searched through a sentence "This is a project demo", both "project" and "demo" will be compared against
"this", "is", "a", "project", "demo" and produce a relevance score.

[NOTE]
Using short target string like "is" is not recommended, since it can be matched to many other words like
"a", "I", "am" etc, which appears in almost every email.

Examples:

`fuzzySearch project demo`

==== Auto parsing and tagging of emails
This feature is automatically triggered by fetching emails from Outlook Server and adding new keyword. It
will automatically parse "keywords" that might be  shown in your emails in different forms/expressions.

For example, the keyword `CS2113T` might be in the expression of `CS2113T`, `CS2113`, `Akshay Narayan`,
`Akshay` etc. All emails containing these expressions will be recognized as containing the keyword
`CS2113T`. This helps the email manager to better categorize your emails. For example, some emails might not
explicitly include the module code, still belong to that module as it is sent by the lecturer.

For easier usage and testing, we have prepared a few default keyword + expressions pair as shown in Figure
3, which will be loaded when the program starts.

[#default-keywords]
[caption="Figure 3: Default keywords of email auto-parsing"]
image::defaultKeywords.png[Default Keywords, 400]

If the email contains some expressions, the respective keyword will be used to tag that email. It can be
seen from the `#` sign on the email list. When showing the email using `show` command, the parsed
expressions will also be highlighted in yellow (except for SPAMs).

[NOTE]
The parsing only allows exact matching of words, which means expression `2113` will not be matched with
text `CS2113`. Any extra characters before and after the word will not be accepted. This is to avoid
unintentional match for short expressions. Please add more expressions if you want more matching patterns.

[NOTE]
Some emails have pictures in it, and obviously we do not intend to capture the words in those pictures.

[TIP]
To test this feature, you are recommended to use `addKeyword` command, or sending email to the dummy
mailbox. Remember to call `fetch` command after sending and leave a few seconds for the email to be
transmitted before calling the `fetch`.

==== Add Keyword: `addKeyword`
Format: `addKeyword KEYWORD -exp EXPRESSION1 [-exp EXPRESSION2]...`
Adds a keyword or expressions to the keyword list. If the keyword is already in the list, the expression
will be added to the expressions belonging to that keyword. So this is a command to add both keyword and
expression.

Examples:

`addKeyword Project -exp project -exp demo`

`addKeyword Notice -exp announcement`

[TIP]
The easiest way to verify whether this command is working properly is to check whether the email
containing the expression has a tag of this keyword in the email list, or just use `show ITEM_NUMBER`
command to see whether the expressions are correctly highlighted. Please call the `show` command again
after adding the keyword if you have already opened an email.

[NOTE]
All emails will be parsed again upon the updates in keyword and expression, so the window might freeze for
a while. Please wait patiently.

==== Listing all keywords: `listKeyword`
Format: `listKeyword`

Gives a list of all keywords with the relevant expressions.

==== Delete keyword (coming in v1.4)

==== Tagging an email: `update`
Format: `update ITEM_NUMBER -tag TAG1 [-tag TAG2]...`

Tags the specified item with the tag(s) minimum number of tags is 1. Tags without duplication will be added.

Examples:

`update 1 -tag CS2113T`

`update 2 -tag Tutorial -tag Spam`

==== Listing all tags: `listTag`
Format: `listTag`

Gives a list of all existing tags in the list of emails.

==== Filtering email by tags: `list`
Format: `list [-tag TAG1] [-tag TAG2]`

Gives a list of emails with the tags given. Minimum number of tags is 1, and the maximum number of tags is 2.

[NOTE]
`TAG1` *exists* if there is at least an email tagged with `TAG1`.

[NOTE]
`TAG1` and `TAG2` *co-exist* if there is at least an email tagged with both tags at the same time.

[NOTE]
Both `TAG1` and `TAG2` *exist but not co-exist* means that there is at least one email with `TAG1` and
another email with `TAG2`, but no email is tagged with both `TAG1` and `TAG2`.

Explanation:

* User input: `list [-tag TAG1]`
** Case 1: `TAG1` exists, for each tag *co-existing* with `TAG1`, the program shows a list of emails
tagged with both `TAG1` and the `co-existing tag`.
** Case 2: `TAG1` does not exit, the program returns an error message.

* User input: `list [-tag TAG1] [-tag TAG2]`
** Case 1: Both `TAG1` and `TAG2` do not exist, the program returns an error message.
** Case 2: Either `TAG1` or `TAG2` exists, the program shows a list of emails with either `TAG1` or
`TAG2`.
** Case 3: `TAG1` and `TAG2` exist but do not co-exist, the program shows two separate list of emails with
`TAG1` and
`TAG2` respectively.
** Case 4: `TAG1` and `TAG2` co-exist, the program shows a list of emails with both `TAG1` and `TAG2`.


Examples:

`list -tag Spam`: If `Spam` does not exist, an error will be returned. If `Spam` exists, for *each* tag
co-existing with `Spam`, a list of emails tagged with the `co-existing tag` and `Spam` will be listed out.

`list -tag CS2113T -tag Tutorial`: If `CS2113T` and `Tutorial` co-exist, emails tagged with both
`CS2113T` and `Tutorial` will be listed out. If no email is tagged with both tags (`CS2113T` and `Tutorial`
do not co-exist), emails tagged with each of the tags will be listed out respectively.

[TIP]
After obtaining the list of emails with the tags, you can enter `show ITEM_NUMBER` to view the content
of email, `ITEM_NUMBER` of an email is the index number of the email in the list.


==== Deleting a local email: `delete`
Format: `delete ITEM_NUMBER`

Deletes the email specified from local storage.

Examples:

`delete 1`: deletes the first email in the email list from local storage.

[NOTE]
If you enter `show ITEM_NUMBER`, then followed with `delete ITEM_NUMBER`, the content of email at
`ITEM_NUMBER` will still remains displayed although the email has been deleted.

[NOTE]
This command will only delete email from local storage. If you enter `delete 1`, after that you enter `fetch`
command or relaunch the program, provided that the deleted email is present in your remote server, that
particular email will be loaded into your local storage again even if you have deleted it before.

==== Clear local email list: `clear`
Format: `clear`

This command deletes all emails in the list from local storage.

When you have accumulate too many emails in the email list, auto-parsing function will take
longer time to complete, if you do not need the older emails in your list, this function can `clear` your
email list.

[WARNING]
Once executed, you will not be able to undo this command.

[TIP]
After clearing all the emails from local storage, you can enter `fetch` to retrieve latest 60 emails from
server. Those cleared email will be loaded into your local storage again provided that it is present in your
remote server.

==== Sending email (coming in v2.0)

==== Auto delete emails (coming in v2.0)

==== Linking emails to tasks (coming in v2.0)

==== Apply priority level (coming in v2.0)

=== Saving data
Data is automatically saved after any command modifies the file. +
