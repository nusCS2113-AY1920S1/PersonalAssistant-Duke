== Introduction

Welcome to the *Email Manager* Developer Guide!

.Main window of Email Manager
image::Ui.png[UI, 800]

*Email Manager* is an email and task manager app, specifically designed for NUS School of Computing Students to manage their emails and busy schedules.
As a text-based application, it is optimized for those who prefer typing and working with Command Line Interface (CLI).
Email Manager also has a developed Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to view email and task details in an appealing, well-organized format.

== About the Developer Guide

This developer guide provides detailed documentation on the implementation of all the various features Email Manager offers.
It also suggests methods for you to modify and build upon it. +
Throughout this developer guide, there will be various icons used, as shown below:

== Setting up

This section shows how to set up Email Manager on your desktop and begin your development journey.

== Design

=== Architecture

==== Overall Architecture

[#overall-architecture]
.Overall Architecture
image::OverallArchitecture.png[Overall Architecture, 400]

The overall architecture design is as shown in Figure 1. Upon the start of the program, `Storage` loads local
files
to update `Model`.

The user interact with the `UI`, which passes on the user input to `Logic` for parsing. Parsed command will be
executed to modify `Model`. Once `Model` is modified, it updates the `UI` display and calls the `Storage` to
update the local files.

==== UI component

[#ui-component]
.UI Component
image::UIComponent.png[UI Component, 400]

The `UI` class is the "gateway" of all the ui components. `Model` must go through the ui component
to update the display and the user input will be passed to the `Logic` for parsing.

`TaskCard` and `DialogBox` are generated and displayed on the main window during run time. `KeyBinding` and
`UserInputHandler` are helper class to handle the input and hotkeys.

==== Logic component

[#logic-component]
.Logic Component
image::LogicComponent.png[Logic Component, 800]

`Logic` component mainly takes in user input from `UI` and generates command to execute. All inputs first
go into `CommandParseHelper` which check for input format and do preliminary information extraction. It
generates common commands if possible.

If the input is not about a common command, the `CommandParseHelper` will call `EmailCommandParseHelper` or
`TaskCommandParseHelper` to parse the input depending on the input prefix. Email command or Task command
will be generated by these two parsers respectively.

All common, email and task commands inherit from abstract class `Command`. The reason why we do not create
`EmailCommand` and `TaskCommand` is because there is no major difference between commands for the task and
for the email. Then the `Command` is executed which modifies the `Model`.

==== Model component

[#model-component]
.Model Component
image::ModelComponent.png[Model Component, 600]

The `Model` contains a `TaskList`, a `EmailList` and a `EmailKeywordPairList`. They store `Task`, `Email`
and `KeywordPair` respectively. The three lists all inherit from `ArrayList`.

==== Common classes

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features in *Email Manager* are implemented.
// Maybe in the future we split the sub-sections into overall command structure, email management, task management and GUI?

=== Task Management

There are three main types of tasks that Duke Email Manager works with: `todo`, `deadline` and `event`.

==== Natural Dates Support

Natural dates support helps to speed up the process at which users enter their task details so that their
task can be added into the task list quickly. The benefits of having this Natural Dates support are:

* Reduce the time and effort needed to key in the date and time for deadline and event tasks.

|===
|ℹ️|This feature only works with `deadline` and `event` tasks.

|===

===== Implementation

The following sequence diagram below illustrates how this feature works:

.Natural Dates Support Sequence diagram
image::TaskParseNaturalDate (1) (2).png[Natural Dates Support, 800]

As seen from the diagram above, the Natural Dates support is facilitated by three classes, namely
`TaskCommandParseHelper`, `CommandParseHelper` and `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper`.

`TaskParseNaturalDateHelper` is under the Command component.
It implements the following operations:

* `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#isCorrectNaturalDate(day)` - Checks if `day` is a day of the week
* `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#convertNaturalDate(day, time)` - Converts string day and time to local date and time in LocalTimeDate format
* `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#getDate(timeString)` - Returns a dateTime in LocalDateTime format
* `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#parseDate(timeString)` - Converts timeString to LocalDateTime format if
timeString is of `dd/MM/yyyy HHmm` format

`TaskCommandParseHelper` and `CommandParseHelper` are under the Parser component.
It implements the following operations:

* `TaskCommandParseHelper#parseTaskTime(optionList)` - Parses time string extracted from optionList and returns a dateTime in LocalDateTime format
* `TaskCommandParseHelper#checkTimeString(timeString)` - Checks if time string contains time component and returns a pair with day as key and timing as value
* `CommandParseHelper#extractTime(optionList)` - Extracts and returns the time string from the input

Given below is an example usage scenario and how Natural Dates Support behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user launches the application. The input type is currently in `email` mode.
The user wishes to add a task and keys in `flip` to switch input type to `task` mode.

*Step 2*: The user executes `deadline homework -time Mon 1200` to add a new deadline task. `UI` component captures the input and passes to `Logic` component to parse the input.

* `CommandParseHelper` takes in the `input`, parses and extracts the options and stores it inside ArrayList<Option>  `optionList`, then passes the `input` and `optionList` to `TaskCommandParseHelper`.

*Step 3*: `TaskCommandParseHelper` takes in the command, parses and extracts the time string of the task by calling `CommandParseHelper#extractTime(optionList)`.

*Step 4*: The extracted time string will go through `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#getDate(timeString)`, which calls `TaskCommandParseHelper#checkTimeString(timeString)` and retrieves dateTimeString = new Pair<>(day, time).

*Step 5*: If `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#isCorrectNaturalDate(day)` is true,
`TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#convertNaturalDate(day, time)` is called, else
`TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#parseDate(timeString)` is called.

*Step 6*: `TaskCommandParseHelper#parseTaskTime(optionList)` retrieve dateTime from
`TaskParseNaturalDateHelper` and returns it.

* The next nearest date is returned according to the input day
** E.g. When the timeString inputted is `sun 1200`, the date of the next nearest Sunday is returned.

===== Design Considerations

Aspect: Handling of parsed time string

* Alternative 1 (chosen): `TaskCommandParseHelper#checkTimeString(timeString)` parses and returns the time
string as a string pair that stores day as key and time as value.
** Pros: Easier to use the day and time in the pair in other methods without having to extract it from time
string again.
** Cons: Does not check whether day and time in the pair is valid, the pair can be any string.
`TaskCommandParseHelper#checkTimeString(timeString)` is called from another class which increase dependency.

* Alternative 2: Parse the time string and extract day or time before each use in `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper`
** Pros: Able to validate if time string is valid before it is called by other methods. Easier to write tests.
** Cons: Might have duplicated codes.

==== Sorting of Task List

The task list can be sorted according to what the user prefer.
The benefits of having this sorting feature are:

* Easier viewing of task list when the list is sorted.
* Faster checking of task list when the list is sorted.

|===
|ℹ️|Task list can be sorted by `priority`, `status` and `time` only.

|===

===== Implementation

The following sequence diagram below illustrates how the sort command is parsed:

.parseSortCommand Sequence diagram
image::parseSortCommand (1) (1).png[Parse Sort Command, 800]

As seen from the diagram above, the parsing of sort command is facilitated by two class, namely
`TaskCommandParseHelper` and `TaskSortCommand`.

`TaskCommandParseHelper` is under the Parser component.
It implements the following operations:

* `TaskCommandParseHelper#parseSortCommand(input)` - Parse the input and extracts the sort type(sortBy) after the command `sort`
** E.g. `sort priority` -> sortBy = "priority"

`TaskSortCommand` is under the Command component.
It implements the following operations:

* `TaskSortCommand#getSortType(sortBy)` - Checks sortBy and returns the sort type if sortBy is valid

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `parseSortCommand` behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user launches the application.
The input type is currently in `email` mode.
The user wishes to check the task list and key in `flip` to switch input type to `task` mode.

*Step 2*: The user executes `sort priority` to sort the task list according to its priority. `UI` component captures the input and passes to `Logic` component to parse the input.

*Step 3*:  `TaskCommandParseHelper#parseSortCommand(input)` is called and extracts the sort type called
sortBy.

*Step 4*:  `TaskSortCommand#getSortType(sortBy)` is then called and returns the sort type according to sortBy

* E.g. If sortBy = "priority", sortType.PRIORITY will be returned.

*Step 5*: `TaskCommandParseHelper` returns new `TaskSortCommand(sortType)`

The following sequence diagram below illustrates how the sort command works:

.TaskSortCommand Sequence diagram
image::TaskSortCommand.png[Task Sort Command, 800]

As seen from the diagram above, the sort command is facilitated by four class, namely `TaskSortCommand`,
`Model`, `TaskList` and `UI`.

The following operations are implemented:

* `TaskSortCommand#execute(model)` - executes the sort command
* `Model#getTaskList()` - returns current task list
* `TaskList#setSortType(sortType)` - sets the sort type of the task list to `sortType`
* `TaskList#constructSortMessage(sortType)` - returns responseMsg
* `UI#showResponse(responseMSg)` - display responseMsg

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `TaskSortCommand` behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user executes `sort status` to sort the task list according to whether it is completed or not.

*Step 2*: `Model#getTaskList()` is called and the current taskList is returned.

*Step 3*: `TaskList#setSortType(sortType)` is called and returns a response message after calling
`TaskList#constructSortMessage(sortType)`.

*Step 4*: The UI displays the response message and `TaskSortCommand#execute(model)` returns true if the
sort type in `TaskList` is set correctly.

The following activity diagram shows the method `sortByType()` that changes how the task list is sorted
according to the sort type:

.sortByType activity diagram
image::sortByType.png[Sort By Type, 800]

|===
|ℹ️|The task list is sorted according to time by default.

|===

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `TaskSortCommand` behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user wishes sort the task list according to the priority level of the tasks and executes
`sort priority`.

*Step 2*: The sort type is changed to `PRIORITY` from `TIME`, and the sorting method is changed.

*Step 3*: `sortByType() is called by `Model#updateGuiTaskList()` on every user input to keep task list sorted.

|===
|ℹ️|
|sorted by `priority`|tasks with higher priority will be at the top of the task list.
|sorted by `status`|tasks that are not completed will be at the top of the task list.
|sorted by `time`|deadline or event tasks with nearing date and time will be at the top of the task list.
|===

===== Design Considerations

Aspect: When the sorting of task list occurs

* Alternative 1 (chosen): The task list is sorted whenever the GUI is updated.
** Pros: Ensures that the task list will always be sorted according to how the user wants.
** Cons: Sort command is executed on every user input to keep task list sorted and task list view in GUI
updated, which increases the computational load.

* Alternative 2: The task list is sorted in `TaskList` class before it is displayed by the GUI
** Pros: Sort command is called only when needed.
** Cons: Have to consider other commands (e.g. `update`) that will change the task list and requires the
task list to be sorted.

==== Updating of Tags

Tasks have a variety of attributes that a user may want to add or change.
The current attributes that can be modified are: `time`, `doafter`, `priority` and `tags`.
The updating of task details is facilitated by `TaskUpdateCommand`.
It extends `Command`, overriding the `execute` method.

The details of the update mechanism are as follows:

Step 1: `TaskCommandParseHelper` takes in the command from the user input text field, and parses it.
If the command starts with `update` than it will separate all the parameters into an ArrayList, passing it into the `TaskUpdateCommand`.

Step 2: `TaskUpdateCommand.execute()` will then go through the ArrayList, calling the appropriate method in `TaskList`.

Step 3: The method in `TaskList` will retrieve the specified task and call the related setter to change the value.

=== Email Management

==== Email Auto Parsing

The emails fetched or stored locally will be automatically parsed to extract important information for tagging, task creation and reminder purposes.
The parsing consists of two stages, the *format parsing* and *content parsing*.
Email format parsing is to parse the email components like subject, sender and body from the raw string fetched from the server or stored in local file.
The content parsing is to parse the keyword included all components of email.

===== Email Format Parsing

.Email Format Parsing
image::EmailFormatParseHelper.png[Format Parsing, 800]

The email format parsing starts at the call of `ParseFetchResponse(response)`. The variable `response` here
is a string of the http response from the Outlook server to the fetch API call.


It first creates an `EmailList` to store all the emails parsed from the response.
This function only returns the list instead of directly adding the email parsed to the model because the storage or network component will decide whether and how the emails are to added to the model.

Then each email contained in the response of is parsed to a `JSONObject` called `emailJson` for easier manipulation.

With this `emailJson`, `parseComponentsToEmail(emailJson)` is called to extract different components of the json and instantiate an `Email` object to be added to the `emailList` created earlier.

This process repeats until all the email information in the response is processed.

===== Email Content Parsing

.Email Content Parsing
image::EmailContentParseHelper.png[Content Parsing, 800]


Email content parsing is to parse the keyword from different components of an email.

Email content parsing starts with the calling of `allKeywordInEmail(email)` and parse in the email in
`Email` type.

It then gets all the `KeywordPair` from the `KeywordList`.
A `KeywordPair` contains a human readable
`keyword` signifying the "meaning" of the keyword.
It also contains multiple `expressions` which will be looked through the email for matches.

For each email component (subject, sender, body etc), the `keywordInString(emailComponent, keywordPair)` is called to search for matches across these components.
It will then return a relevance score.
Higher relevance score means a more occurrence.
Keyword with all its expressions absent in the email will get a 0 relevance score.
Also, subject and sender will have a higher weights compared to the email body.

Each keyword searched in the email with a relevance score higher than 0 (at least 1 occurrence), will be added to the email as a tag by calling `addTag(keywordPair, relevanceScore)`.

==== Email Tagging

*Email Manager* allows user to tag emails by tags.

===== Current Implementation

* Format: `email update ITEM_NUMBER [-tag TAG1] [-tag TAG2]`​
Following is the activity diagram when the command is executed:

.Activity diagram for email tagging
image::emailTagActivityDiagram.jpg[Email Tag Activity Diagram, 800]

The following sequence diagram below will explain how the `email update` command works in detail:

.Sequence diagram for email tagging
image::emailTagSequenceDiagram.jpg[Email Tag Sequence Diagram, 800]

An example usage of the command is as follows:

*Step 1*: The user launches the application.
The user inputs `email update 2 -tag Fun -tag Project`

*Step 2*: `UI` component captures the input and passes to `Logic` component to parse the input.
Section below explains how `Logic` component parse the input.

* `CommandParseHelper` takes in the `input`, parses and extracts tags information and stores it inside ArrayList<Option>  `optionList`, then passes the `input` and `optionList` to `EmailCommandParseHelper`.
** `input` here is `email update 2`
** `optionList` here is `[tag=Fun, tag=Project]`
* `EmailCommandParseHelper` parses the `index` of email and extract tags information `optionList` and stores it in ArrayList<String> `tags`.
** `index` here is `2`
** `tags` here is `[Fun, Project]`
* `EmailCommandParseHelper` creates a new `EmailTagCommand` by passing in `index` and `tags`, then return the `EmailTagCommand` to `CommandParseHelper` and then to `UI`

*Step 3* : `EmailTagCommand#execute(model)` is called by `UI`.

*Step 4*: `EmailTagCommand` calls `Model#getEmailList()`, then `emailList` is returned by `Model`.

*Step 5*: `EmailTagCommand` calls `EmailList#addTags(index, tags)`

* `EmailList` calls `get(index)` to get the email of the index number in the emailList.
** Gets the 2nd email in the emailList.
* For each `tag` in `tags`, `EmailList` calls `Email#addTag(tag)`. `Email` calls `tags.add()` to add the tag to the email.
** Each `tag` here is `Fun` and `Project`.

*Step 6*: `EmailList` returns a String `responseMsg` to `EmailTagCommand`.

** `responseMsg` here is: +
 "Tags added: [Project, Fun] to email: <title of email at index 2>"

===== Design Considerations

Aspect: Handling updating of tags

* Alternative 1 (current choice): if at least one tag is entered as part of the command, it will overwrite all current tags of the task being modified.
** Pros: makes it consistent with other parameters of the update command and gives users an option to replace/remove tags
** Cons: if there are many tags, and the user only wants to add on an extra tag, the user will need to retype all existing tags into the command.
* Alternative 2: if a tag is entered as part of the command, it will amend on top of existing tags.
** Pros: this will save users time if they only want to add on tags
** Cons: no option to remove tags
* Alternative 3 (proposed): there will be an option to add tags and an option to remove tags.
** Pros: gives users highest amount of flexibility and control over the tags they want to keep.
** Cons: added complexity in commands

==== Email Filtering by Tag(s)

*Email Manager* allows user to filter emails by tag(s).

===== Current Implementation

* Format: `list [-tag TAG1] [-tag TAG2]…`

* Note: Gives a list of emails with the tags.
Minimum number of tags is 1, and the maximum is 2.
* Eg: `email list -tag Fun -tag Project`

Following is the activity diagram when the command is executed:

.Activity diagram for email filtering by tags
image::emailFilterActivityDiagram.jpg[Email Filtering Activity Diagram, 800]

The following sequence diagram below will explain how the `email update` command works in detail:

.Sequence diagram for email filtering by tags
image::emailFilterSequenceDiagram.jpg[Email Filter Sequence Diagram, 800]


An example usage of the command is as follows:

*Step 1* : The user launches the application.
The user wishes to tag the 2nd email in the list with "Fun" and "Project" (Implementation of part is explained in Section 5.3.2).
After tagging the email, the user wishes to view the list of emails with these tags, hence the user inputs `email list -tag Fun -tag Project`.

*Step 2* : `UI` component captures the input and passes to `Logic` component to parse the input.
Section below explains how `Logic` component parse the input.

* `CommandParseHelper` takes in the `input`, parses and extracts tags information and stores it inside ArrayList<Option>  `optionList`, then passes the `input` and `optionList` to `EmailCommandParseHelper`.
** `input` here is `email list`
** `optionList` here is `[tag=Fun, tag=Project]`
* `EmailCommandParseHelper` parses the `input` and extract tags information `optionList` and stores it in ArrayList<String> `tags`.
** `tags` here is `[Fun, Project]`
* `EmailCommandParseHelper` creates a new `EmailTagListCommand` by passing in `tags`, then return the `EmailTagListCommand` to `CommandParseHelper` and then to `UI`

*Step 3* : `EmailFilterByTagCommand#execute(model)` is called by `UI`.

*Step 4*: `EmailFilterByTagCommand` calls `EmailTags#filterByEmailTag(tags, emailList)`, which calls
`EmailTags#getTaggedEmailList(tags, emailList)`.


*Step 5*: `getTaggedEmailList()` checks the conditions of the each tags in `tags`, we say that a tag exists
if there
is email with the tag. If none of the emails has the tag, we say that the tag does not exist. We say that
both tags co-exist if there is email tagged with both tags.

** In this example, both tags `Fun` and `Project` co-exist.

*Step 6*: `getTaggedEmailList()` calls `TagMap.get("Fun").get("Project")`. `TagMap` returns `indexList`
which is the *index* of all email(s) tagged with both `Fun` and `Project`.

*Step 7*: `getTaggedEmailList()` constructs a String `responseMsg` containing the list of title of emails
from the `indexList`. After that, `getTaggedEmailList()` returns the `responseMsg` to `filterByEmailTag`, then
to `EmailFilterByTagCommand` and to the `UI`.

** `responseMsg` here is: +
"Here is the email tagged with both #Project and #Fun: <list of title of email(s) with both tags>"

===== Design Considerations

* Alternative 1 (current choice): +
The tags associated with emails is stored in `TagMap`:

** TagMap is a `HashMap<String, SubTagMap>`:
*** Each `key` in the HashMap is a tag name (we call it `root tag name` here) that exists in the email list.
*** The `value` associated with each `key` is a `SubTagMap`.

** `SubTagMap` is a `HashMap<String, EmailList>`:
*** Each `key` in the HashMap is a tag name (we call it `sub tag name` here) that co-exists with the `root tag
name` from the `TagMap`.
We say that both tags co-exist if there is email tagged with both tags.
*** The `value` associated with each `key` is an `EmailList`, which is the list of emails tagged with both
`root tag name` and `sub tag name`.

** For example, let `emailOne` be an email tagged with `Tutorial` and `CS2113T`, `emailTwo` be an email tagged with `Tutorial` and `CG2271`.
*** After calling `EmailTags#updateEmailTagList`, the TagMap has the following structure: +
{ +
    Tutorial={Tutorial=emailOne emailTwo, CS2113T=emailOne, CG2271=emailTwo}, +
    CS2113T={CS2113T=emailOne, Tutorial=emailOne}, +
    CG2271={CG2271=emailTwo, Tutorial= emailTwo} +
}

** Pros: Faster search when user invokes `EmailTagListCommand`, since `EmailTags#displayEmailTagList` is navigating in the HashMap.
** Cons: Current implementation invokes the `EmailTags#updateEmailTagList` on every user input to keep the tagMap and email list view in GUI updated, which increases the computational load.

* Alternative 2: +
Loop through each tag of each email in the list of emails, and check if the each tag equals to the tag requested by the user, if yes, add the email to the list, if no, continue with the loop.
After finishing the loop, output the email(s) in the list.

** Pros: This implementation does not have to maintain a TagMap structure to keep track of the emails with the tags, therefore does not requires update of the TagMap, this saves the space and computational load of the program.
** Cons: Slower search when user invokes `EmailTagListCommand`, since it has to loop through each tag of each email in the list of emails.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

===== Current Implementation

* The logging level can be controlled using the logLevel
* The Logger for a class can be obtained using LogsCenter.getLogger(Class) which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: Console and to a .log file in `data/logs` folder with the format
`"log" + "yyyyMMdd_HHmm" + ".log"`.
* Logging Levels
** SEVERE : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
** WARNING : Can continue, but with caution
** INFO : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
** FINE : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

== Documentation

== Testing

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

We use https://gradle.org/[Gradle] for _build automation.
See link:{repoURL}/tutorials/gradleTutorial.md[Gradle Tutorial] for more details.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

. Update the archiveVersion number of shadowJar in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`].
. Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
. https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries.
For example, *Email manager* depends on the https://openjfx.io/[JavaFX] for GUI support.
Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle.
For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Instructions for Manual Testing
Please follow the following feature testing tables to do the manual testing. The actual output and error
message are to be checked against the expected output in the table. If Internet access is not available,
please copy the content in the `/data/test_data` folder to the `/data` folder and overwrite all. These two
folders
will be automatically generated once the program is started. +
Please ensure the program is copied to an empty folder before starting the testing to avoid any data
contamination. Any manual changes to the data folder might affect the program from function normally and is
not recommended.

[NOTE]
As we are using key mapping for certain hotkeys, you will not be able to use `Ctrl + V` for pasting.
However, you can right click on the input box and choose paste to paste the test input.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more
exploratory testing.

==== Email Auto Parsing and AddKeyword Command
Since the email content parsing is automatic, it is easier to be tested together with the addKeyword command.

[NOTE]
All the expression match is case insensitive and full match, meaning that 'cs' can be matched to 'CS' but
not 'CS2101'.

|===
| Mode | Input | Expected Result | Purpose of Testing

| `email` | `addKeyword Notice -exp announcement` | All emails with the word 'announcement' in its subject,
sender or body will have #Notice on the list | Normal use case of addKeyword and auto parsing
| `email` | `addKeyword Project -exp project -exp demo` | All emails with the word 'project' or 'demo'
in its subject, sender or body will have #Project on the list | Normal use case with multiple
expressions in one keyword
| `email` | `addKeyword Project Demo -exp project -exp demo` | All emails with the word 'project' or 'demo'
in its subject, sender or body will have #Project Demo on the list | Normal use case with space in keyword
| `email` | `addKeyword Demo -exp final demo` | All emails with the word 'final demo'
in its subject, sender or body will have #Demo on the list | Normal use case with space in expression
| `email` | `addKeyword Project Demo -exp luminus` | All emails with the word 'luminus' in its subject,
sender, or body will have #Project Demo on the list. Those emails already have #Project Demo will not be
affected | Normal use case with new expression but existing keyword
| `email` | `addKeyword 46 -exp 46` | All emails with '46' in its subject, sender or body will have #46 on
the list | Normal use case with numbers in keyword and expression

option should trigger the invalid command format check as option must not be empty
| `email` | `addKeyword project -exp !@#` | Invalid command format reported | Invalid character in input
will trigger the invalid command format check
|===

==== Email Fuzzy Search

[NOTE]
For performance reasons, fuzzy search will only be done word by word. For example, if "project demo" is to
be searched through a sentence "This is a project demo", both "project" and "demo" will be compared against
"this", "is", "a", "project", "demo" and produce a relevance score.

[NOTE]
Using short target string like "is" is not recommended, since it can be matched to many other words like
"a", "I", "am" etc, which appears in almost every email.

|===
| Mode | Input | Expected Result | Purpose of Testing

| `email` | `fuzzySearch Aggarwal` | A few emails sent by Divesh Aggarwal will be listed | Normal use case
with exact match should be captured by fuzzy search
| `email` | `fuzzySearch Aggarwa` | A few emails sent by Divesh Aggarwal will be listed | Normal use case
with edit distance of 1 should be captured by fuzzy search
| `email` | `fuzzySearch Aggarw` | A few emails sent by Divesh Aggarwal will be listed | Normal use case
with edit distance of 2 should be captured by fuzzy search
| `email` | `fuzzySearch Aggar` | No email will be listed | Normal use case with edit distance of 3 will
not be captured by fuzzy search
| `email` | `fuzzySearch Divesh Aggarwal` | A few emails sent by Divesh Aggarwal will be listed | Normal
use case with more than two target words should be captured properly
| `email` | `fuzzySearch CS2113` | Many emails about CS2113T, CS2101, CS2102 should be listed, with CS2113T
emails generally listed first | Normal use case when multiple words can be matched but the most relevant
should be listed first
