== Introduction

Welcome to the *Email Manager* Developer Guide!

*Email Manager* is an email and task manager app, specifically designed for NUS School of Computing Students
to manage their emails and busy schedules. As a text-based application, it is optimized for those who prefer
typing and working with Command Line Interface (CLI). Email Manager also has a developed Graphical User
Interface (GUI) that allows users to view email and task details in an appealing, well-organized format.

== About the Developer Guide

This developer guide provides detailed documentation on the implementation of all the various
features Email Manager offers. It also suggests methods for you to modify and build upon it. +

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features in *Email Manager* are implemented.
// Maybe in the future we split the sub-sections into overall command structure, email management, task management and GUI?

=== Task Management
There are three main types of tasks that Email Manager works with: `todo`, `deadline` and `event`.

==== Natural Dates Support

The email manager aims to help computing students handle their tasks efficiently. Therefore, one of its main
goals is to speed up the process at which students enter their task details so that their task can be added
into the task list quickly. The benefits of having this Natural Dates support are:

* Reduce the time and effort needed to key in the date and time for deadline and event tasks.

The Natural Dates support is facilitated by two main classes, namely `TaskCommandParseHelper` and `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper`.

`TaskParseNaturalDateHelper` is an element of the will retrieve the parsed time string from
`TaskCommandParseHelper` and convert
the extracted string to LocalDateTime format. It implements the following operations:

* `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#isCorrectNaturalDate(input)` - Checks if input contains natural date format.
* `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#convertNaturalDate(day, time)` - Converts string day and time to local date in
LocalTimeDate format.
* `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#getDate(input)` - Returns a date and time(if applicable) after checking if
natural date input contains a time element.

`TaskCommandParseHelper` is an element of the Command component. It handles all parsing of inputs when the
input type is set to `task`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how Natural Dates Support behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application. The input type is currently in `email` mode. The user wishes
to add a task and key in `flip` to switch input type to `task` mode.

Step 2: The user executes `deadline homework -time Mon 1200` to add a new deadline task.

* `TaskCommandParseHelper` takes in the command, parses and extracts the date and time information of the task
 and saves it inside a list of type `ArrayList<Command.Option>`.
* The extracted date and time will go through `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#getDate()`, which calls the relevant
 methods in the class to process the date and time.

Step 3: The user wishes to update the date and time for the task above, let the task above be task 1 in the
task list. The user executes `update 1 -time Tue` to change the task date from Mon to Tue.

* `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper` will be called to process the time information and update the task accordingly.
 When no time is entered, the time is set to 0000 (HHmm).

==== Updating of Tags

Tasks have a variety of attributes that a user may want to add or change. The current attributes that
can be modified are: `time`, `doafter`, `priority` and `tags`.
The updating of task details is facilitated by `TaskUpdateCommand`. It extends `Command`, overriding the `execute` method.

The details of the update mechanism are as follows:

Step 1: `TaskCommandParseHelper` takes in the command from the user input text field, and parses it.
If the command starts with `update` than it will separate all the parameters into an ArrayList,
passing it into the `TaskUpdateCommand`.

Step 2: `TaskUpdateCommand.execute()` will then go through the ArrayList, calling the appropriate
method in `TaskList`.

Step 3: The method in `TaskList` will retrieve the specified task and call the related setter to change the value.

=== Email Management

==== Email Auto Parsing

The emails fetched or stored locally will be automatically parsed to extract important information for
tagging, task creation and reminder purposes. The parsing consists of two stages, the *format parsing* and
*content parsing*. Email format parsing is to parse the email components like subject, sender and body from
the raw string fetched from the server or stored in local file. The content parsing is to parse the keyword
included all components of email.

===== Email Format Parsing
.Email Format Parsing
[#img-email-format-parsing]
[caption="Figure N: "]
image::EmailFormatParseHelper.png[Format Parsing, 800]
The email format parsing starts at the call of `ParseFetchResponse(response)`. The variable `response` here
is a string of the http response from the Outlook server to the fetch API call.

It first creates an `EmailList` to store all the emails parsed from the response. This function only
returns the list instead of directly adding the
email parsed to the model because the storage or network component will decide whether and how the emails
are to added to the model.

Then each email contained in the response of is parsed to a `JSONObject` called `emailJson` for easier
manipulation.

With this `emailJson`, `parseComponentsToEmail(emailJson)` is called to extract different components of the
json and instantiate an `Email` object to be added to the `emailList` created earlier.

This process repeats until all the email information in the response is processed.

===== Email Content Parsing
.Email Content Parsing
[#img-email-content-parsing]
[caption="Figure N+1: "]
image::EmailContentParseHelper.png[Content Parsing, 800]

Email content parsing is to parse the keyword from different components of an email.

Email content parsing starts with the calling of `allKeywordInEmail(email)` and parse in the email in
`Email` type.

It then gets all the `KeywordPair` from the `KeywordList`. A `KeywordPair` contains a human readable
`keyword` signifying the "meaning" of the keyword. It also contains multiple `expressions` which will be
looked through the email for matches.

For each email component (subject, sender, body etc), the `keywordInString(emailComponent, keywordPair)` is
called to search for matches across these components. It will then return a relevance score. Higher
relevance score means a more occurrence. Keyword with all its expressions absent in the email will get a 0
relevance score. Also, subject and sender will have a higher weights compared to the email body.

Each keyword searched in the email with a relevance score higher than 0 (at least 1 occurrence), will be
added to the email as a tag by calling `addTag(keywordPair, relevanceScore)`.

== Dev Ops

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Handling updating of tags
* Alternative 1 (current choice): if at least one tag is entered as part of the command, it will overwrite all current tags of the task being modified.
** Pros: makes it consistent with other parameters of the update command and gives users an option to replace/remove tags
** Cons: if there are many tags, and the user only wants to add on an extra tag, the user will need to retype all existing tags into the command.
* Alternative 2: if a tag is entered as part of the command, it will amend on top of existing tags.
** Pros: this will save users time if they only want to add on tags
** Cons: no option to remove tags
* Alternative 3 (proposed): there will be an option to add tags and an option to remove tags.
** Pros: gives users highest amount of flexibility and control over the tags they want to keep.
** Cons: added complexity in commands
