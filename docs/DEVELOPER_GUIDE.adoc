== Setting Up
Refer to the guide https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F11-1/main/blob/master/docs/SETTING_UP.md[here] for setting up.

== Design
Building in progress.. :hammer:

== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. +

*A. Exporting Data as CSV Files*

1. Implementation (Proposed)
- We will be planning to use OpenCSV for my primary implementation of exporting CSV files.
- OpenCSV is an easy-to-use CSV parser library for Java. It was developed because all the CSV parsers at the time didn’t have commercial-friendly licenses.
- For openCSV, the minimum version of Java supported is Java7.
- We will be reading in objects from our project, and exporting them as a CSV file.
- The command for exporting a CSV file will be just exportcsv. It would then read the data stored and export as CSV file, with headers preset.
- If there is a empty slot in the object field, during the export of the CSV file, it would appear as empty as well. Hence not running error while exporting.
- If the export command fails its execution, it will not call the program to execute the command. Hence the data will not be exported as a CSV file.

2. Design Considerations
- Pros and Cons of openCSV
- Pros: +
It is quick and easy way to read CSV. +
+
It is also good to use it from Play framework (trough a scala wrapper) to read bulk user data.
- Cons: +
There some issues with quotes, etc. No progress on that since 2012.

3. Configuration
- Configuration of openCSV depends on the build of the project.
- Dependency Information for:
- Gradle/Grails: +
`compile 'com.opencsv:opencsv:5.0'`
- Maven Users: +
`<dependency>
<groupId>com.opencsv</groupId>
<artifactId>opencsv</artifactId>
<version>5.0</version>
</dependency>`
- Apache Buildr: +
`'com.opencsv:opencsv:jar:5.0'`
- Apache Ivy: +
`<dependency org="com.opencsv" name="opencsv" rev="5.0">
<artifact name="opencsv" type="jar" />
</dependency>`
- Groovy Grape: +
`@Grapes(
@Grab(group='com.opencsv', module='opencsv', version='5.0')
)`
- Scala SBT: +
`libraryDependencies += "com.opencsv" % "opencsv" % "5.0"`
- Leiningen: +
`[com.opencsv/opencsv "5.0"]`

4. Alternatives for exporting CSV files
- Using Java CSV +
Java CSV is a small fast open source Java library for reading and writing CSV and plain delimited text files. All kinds of CSV files can be handled, text qualified, Excel formatted, etc.

*B. Reminders Feature*

1. Implementation of Reminders Feature.
The reminders mechanism is facilitated by the RemindersCommand. It extends upon Command.
This is stored internally within the RemindersList & UnauthorisedList based on the model LockerList which will then be stored within the FileHandling class.
Once the application starts the RemindersList & UnauthorisedList will be booted up from the file storage and be viewed through the GUI.

- RemindersList will contain lockers that are only going to be expired within 3 days.
- UnauthorisedList will contain lockers that are in unauthorised usage.

The logic found in the Find feature will be used to continuously add into the UnauthorisedList.

2.
Design Considerations

Use of Data Structures:

    * Using a List data structure
    - Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
    - Cons: Will need to keep a separate list.


*B. Find Feature*

1. Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by the FindCommand. It extends upon Command.
Use cases for the find feature:

- Find the locker details based on name.
- Find the locker details based on other tags like availability.

2. Design Considerations

How the find feature executes:

    * Search by single tag: Find /n Kevin
- Pros: Easy to implement
- Cons: Will only be able to filter less and show a list instead.

    * Search multiple tags: Find /n Kevin Alvarez /t unauthorised
- Pros: Able to find lockers accurately
- Cons: May need to spell the phrase correctly as it searched the whole string of characters rather than the most similar number of characters.

*C. Sort Feature*

1. Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by the SortCommand. It extends upon Command.
Use cases for the sort feature:

- Sort the lockers based on name.
- Sort the lockers based on other tags like unauthorised usage.

2.
Design Considerations

How the sort feature executes:

* Sort by single tag: Find /t unauthorised
- Pros: Easy to implement
- Cons: Will only be able to filter less and show a list instead.

* Sort multiple tags: Find /t broken /t unauthorised
- Pros: Able to find lockers accurately
- Cons: May take some time to as it will sort tag by tag

*D. Undo and Redo Feature*

1. Implementation (Proposed)
SpongeBob has _Undo and Redo Feature_ that allows its users to perform changes to the history of commands as follows:
* Every time when the user key in a command in SpongeBob for it to perform an operation, the command will be stored

* Two stacks are used to store the history of commands typed by the user:
** previousCommandStack: store the previous commands
** erasedCommandStack: store the erased commands

* Undo: erases the last command key in by the user
** pop the command at the top in previousCommandStack and push it to erasedCommandStack
** revert the last operation performed on SpongeBob
** SpongeBob will go back to its previous state

* Redo: recalls the last command erased by the user
** pop the command at the top in erasedCommandStack and push it to previousCommandStack
** perform the last operation reverted on SpongeBob
** SpongeBob will go back to its previous aborted state

* User is able to undo and redo up to the last five history of commands

2. Design Considerations
* Pros:
** user can redo/undo commands if they typed wrongly
** user can redo/undo commands if they want to amend it
** ensures SpongeBob support error correction

* Cons:
** user can only redo/undo up to the last 5 commands
** stacks to store command history is cleared every time when SpongeBob is re-launched
** only enables user to revert instead of flexibly changing the previous command
