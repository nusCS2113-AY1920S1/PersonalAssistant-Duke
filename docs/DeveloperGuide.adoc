== Setting up

=== Prerequisites
. *JDK `11`* or above +
[NOTE]
The `oof.jar` file is compiled using the Java version mentioned above. +
. *IntelliJ* IDE
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed.
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer
. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `Oof` and try a few commands
. Run tests to ensure they all pass. _(coming soon)_

== Implementation

=== Recurring task feature

==== Implementation

The `RecurringCommand` class extends `Command` by providing methods to set a current `Task` in the persistent `TaskList` of the main program `OOF` as a recurring task. It also generates future instances of `Task` as indicated by the user.

[NOTE]
`TaskList` is stored internally as an `ArrayList` in the Oof Program as well as externally in persistent storage in `output.txt`.

Additionally, it consists of the following features:

* User can select a `Task` in the `TaskList` to be a recurring task.
* User can choose an integer between `1 - 10` for the number of times the task should recur.
* User can also choose the `Frequency` of recurrence with the choices being `DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY`

These features are implemented in the `parse` method of the `CommandParser` class that parses user input commands.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `RecurringCommand` class behaves at each step.

*Step 1.* +
The user types in `recurring 1 2`. The `parse` method in `CommandParser` class is called to parse the command to obtain integers `1` as the `Index` of the `Task` in `TaskList` and `2` as the `number of recurrences`.

[WARNING]
`OofException` will be thrown if the user enters invalid commands.

*Step 2.* +
The `parse` method then prompts the user to input the `frequency` of recurrence. +

[TIP]

The choices are as follows: +
1. DAILY +
2. WEEKLY + 
3. MONTHLY +
4. YEARLY +

The user chooses `1`. The `parse` method then parses the command to obtain an integer `1` which sets the `Frequency` of recurrence as `DAILY`.

[WARNING]
`OofException` will be thrown if the user enters invalid commands.

*Step 3.* +
A new instance of `RecurringCommand` class is returned to the main `Oof` program with the parameters `1, 2, 1` as described above. The `execute` method of `RecurringCommand` class is then called.

*Step 4.* +
The `setRecurringTask` method in `RecurringCommand` class is then called by `execute` method. This method does three main things: 

* Calls `getTask` method from `TaskList` class to get the user selected `Task`.
* Updates the `Task` to a `recurring Task` by: +
** Calling `setFrequency` method in `Task` class to set `Frequency` to `DAILY`
** Calling `deleteTask` and `addTaskToIndex` methods in `TaskList` class to update the selected `Task`.
* Calls `recurInstances` method in `RecurringCommand` class to set upcoming recurring `Tasks` based on user selected `Number of recurrences` and `Frequency` by:
** `recurInstances` method calls `dateTimeIncrement` method in `RecurringCommand` class to increment the `DateTime` based on the user input `Frequency`.

*Step 5.* +
After `setRecurring` method finishes its execution, the `execute` method continues on to print the updated `TaskList` by calling `printRecurringMessage` method in `Ui` class and saves the new `Tasks` into persistent storage by calling `writeToFile` method in `Storage` class.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::RecurringCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

* *Selecting currently available `Task` to be set as a `recurring Task`*
** Rationale: +
It allows the `RecurringCommand` class to capitalise on the existing features of adding `Deadlines` and `Events. 
** Alternatives considered: +
Allow users to add new `recurring Task` instead of selecting from existing `Tasks`. Allowing users to add new recurring tasks strongly overlaps with existing features and this increase coupling in the `OOF` program.
* *Fixing lower bound and upper bound of the `Number of recurrences` to be `1` and `10` respectively*
** Rationale: + 
It ensures a controlled number of recurrences are added to the `TaskList` instead of being a variable amount as a user may unintentionally break the `TaskList`.
** Alternatives considered: + 
Insert an upcoming recurring task when the `recurring Task` is nearing. There may be too many `Tasks` to keep track and add when `OOF` starts up especially in the case when the number of `Tasks` in the `TaskList` gets potentially large. This decreases the scalability of the project in the long run.
* *`Frequency` fixed to four different default frequencies*
** Rationale: + 
It requires significantly less effort to choose from a default list of four options than to manually type in customised time ranges.
** Alternatives considered: +
Users can enter a customised `Frequency` for the `recurring Task`. It may be a viable option to allow users to set such parameters. However, since the `OOF` program is solely a Command Line Interface program, it may not be user friendly for users to enter so many details just to set a customised `Frequency` for the `recurring Task`.

=== Help feature
==== Implementation
The `HelpCommand` class extends `Command` class by providing functions to display a manual with the list of `Command` available and how they may be used in the main program `OOF`.

[NOTE]
The list of `Command` and their instructions are stored externally in persistent storage in `manual.txt`.

In addition, it contains the following feature:
* User may request for `Help` with a specific command.

All `Help` features are implemented in the `parse` method of `CommandParser` class that parses user input.

Provided below is an example scenario of use and how `HelpCommand` class behaves and interact with other relevant classes.

*Step 1:* +
The user enters `help Deadline`. The `parse` method in `CommandParser` class is called to parse the user input to obtain the String `Deadline` as the `keyword` that the user requires `Help` for.

[WARNING]
`OofException` will be thrown is the user enters an invalid command.

*Step 2:* +
The `execute` method of `HelpCommand` class will read the list of `Command` and their instructions from persistent storage in `manual.txt` and store them into a `commands` ArrayList by calling the `readManual` method from `Storage` class.

* *Step 2a:* +
The `readManual` method of `Storage` class will retrieve and read `manual.txt` from persistent storage by using `FileReader` abstraction on `File` abstraction.
* *Step 2b:* +
The `BufferedReader` abstraction will then be performed upon `FileReader` abstraction to allow `manual.txt` to be read line-by-line, adding each line as an element of the `commands` ArrayList. The `commands` ArrayList is then returned to the `execute` method of `HelpCommand` class.

[WARNING]
`OofException` will be thrown if `manual.txt` is unavailable, resulting in `IOException` getting caught.

*Step 3:* +
If the `keyword` is empty, the `printHelpCommands` method of `Ui` class will be called. The elements of `commands` ArrayList will then be printed in ascending order through the use of a for loop. +

If the `keyword` is specified, the `individualQuery` method of `HelpCommand` class will be called with the `keyword` and `commands` ArrayList as parameters.

* *Step 3a:* +
The first segment of each element in the `commands` ArrayList will be retrieved by adding a String `command` delimited by two whitespaces.

* *Step 3b:* +
Once a check is completed to ensure that `command` is not empty, both `keyword` and `command` String will be formatted through the use of `toUpperCase` function and String comparison will be performed through the use of `equals`.
If they match, that particular element of `commands` ArrayList will be stored into a String called `description` and the for loop will break before returning `description` to the `execute` method of `HelpCommand`.

[WARNING]
`OofException` will be thrown is no successful match between `keyword` and `command` String is found.

*Step 4:* +
The `execute` method of `HelpCommand` calls `printHelpCommand` in `Ui` class with `description` String as the parameter. This is where the individual `Command` and its instruction will be printed.

The following activity diagram summarises what will happen when a user executes a `Help` command:

image::HelpCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
* Created `manual.txt` to store available commands and their instructions
** Rationale: +
With scalability in mind, the use of persistent storage will grant developers a common location to update the list of `Command` and their instructions.

** Alternatives Considered: +
Numerous String variables can be added to an ArrayList through the `HelpCommand` class. This would not require the use of `File`, `FileReader` or `BufferedReader` abstractions.
However, this would bring developers inconvenience during project extension as more functions will be added and this may eventually lead to unorganised code, especially in the `HelpCommand` class.

* Implement ArrayList to display `Help` for an individual command and its instructions
** Rationale: +
The use of ArrayList offers flexibility due to its unconfined size. This allows increased convenience and scalability due to the large list of `Command` and their instructions available to our users.

** Alternatives Considered: +
The use of an Array will allow increased efficiency given the smaller number of `Command` we had in our earlier versions, such as `v1.1`.
However, this is not a beneficial solution in the long run as we create extensions and expand upon `OOF`.

=== View tasks for the week feature

image::ViewWeekLarge.png[]

==== Implementation

The `ViewWeekCommand` class extends `Command` by providing methods to display tasks for a particular week.

[NOTE]
The command can be run in the `OOF` program without a specific `date` e.g. `viewweek` instead of `viewweek 01 01 2019`. In this case, the `ViewWeek` command prints tasks for the current week. The same applies if the date entered by the user is invalid.

Features elaborated:

* The output of the `ViewWeekCommand` is ANSI colour enabled.This distinguishes the different days of the week in the output.

[WARNING]
As the output is ANSI colour enabled, there is a need to enable ANSI colour support on Windows machines.

|*Type of fix*|*Description*
|Permanent fix|
Enter the command `CMD / POWERSHELL: reg add HKCU\Console /v VirtualTerminalLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 1` in either `CMD` / `POWERSHELL`.

Launch a new console window to activate the changes.

_Disable line wrapping in terminal for optimal view._|
Adhoc fix for `POWERSHELL`|
run `OOF` with the command `java -jar .\v1.X.jar \| Out-Host`|
|===

* The output of `ViewWeekCommand` resizes automatically based on the length of the `description` of tasks.

image::ViewWeekEmpty.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the 'ViewWeekCommand` class behaves at each step.

[NOTE]
Due to heavy abstraction in the Ui and the limitation of the software used to draw UML diagrams, trivial helper functions in the Ui to print the output will be omitted.

*Step 1.* +
The user types in `viewweek`. The `parse` method in the `CommandParser` class returns a new `ViewWeekCommand` object.

*Step 2.* +
Since no date is passed by the user, the constructor for `ViewWeekCommand` class retrieves the current date using the `calendar.get()` methods. The `execute` method in `ViewWeekCommand` class is then called by the `Oof.run()` method in the main class `Oof`.

*Step 3.* +
In the `execute` method, the first day of the week is retrieved using the `getStartDate()` method in  the current class for indexing purposes. Tasks are to be sorted into the data structure of `ArrayList<ArrayList<String[]>>` called `calendarTasks`. The size of `calendarTasks` is `7` which represents each day in the current week. Each index in `calendarTasks` is an `arrayList`of `string[]` which represents the tasks in that respective day of the week in the form of `{TIME, DESCRIPTION}`.

*Step 4.* +
The `execute` method iterates through the current list of tasks and parses the `date`, `time` and `description` of each task. The `dateMatches()` method is then called to verify if the task falls in the same week as the current week. If the current task falls in the current week, the `date` of the task is compared with the first day of the week to obtain an `index` to slot the task into calendarTasks.

*Step 5.* +
The task is then added to calendarTask using the `addEntry()` method. After iterating through the current list of tasks, the `printViewWeek() method` in `Ui` class is then called to print the tasks for the current week.

*Step 6.* +
In the `printViewWeek()` method, 3 main methods are being called to print the final output. Firstly, `printViewWeekHeader()` method is called to print the header of the output which consists of the top border and the days of the current week.

*Step 7.* +
Secondly, `printViewWeekBody()` method is called to print the dates of the current week in the next line of output.

*Step 8.* +
Lastly, `printViewWeekDetails()` method is called to print relevant empty lines, tasks and the bottom border of the final output.

The following object diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::ViewWeekSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The lifeline of the User is a bar due to limitations in the software used to draw the diagram. Full details of the entire program are omitted to prevent over-cluttering of the diagram. It must be noted that the for loop and condition for `dateMatches` method are also not shown due to software limitations.

==== Design Considerations

* *Resizing column size instead of wrapping description of tasks*
** Rationale: +
Each task has a different description length and timing. Thus, it may be difficult to come up with a logic to wrap at indexes that make the output sensible. Furthermore, it is more difficult to find a one size fits all logic than to resize the columns to fit the task `description` and `time`.
** Alternatives considered: +
Truncating the description of tasks so that no resizing nor wrapping is needed. A lot of information may be lost in this process and the `ViewWeekCommand` may not be very useful to the user in this case.
* *Coloured output instead of plain output*
** Rationale: +
It clearly demarcates the header and borders of the output and highlights the dates shown in the `ViewWeekCommand` output. Without the coloured scheme, users still need to scan through the headers to realise the useful task information is located below it.
** Alternatives considered: +
The tasks in each day can be classified into visual blocks to aid the users into visualising the timeline in each day. In addition to that, the tasks in each day has already been chronologically sorted in the `ViewWeekCommand` class. This alternative can be an extension to be used in conjunction with `Find free time slots` in future milestones.
