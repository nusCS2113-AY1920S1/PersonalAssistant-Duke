== Preface
=== About ArchDuke
Team leaders often face problems managing multiple projects, especially software development projects where the usage of a Kanban board is common.

Having to manage multiple Kanban boards for each individual project is a huge hassle for team leaders.
As such, ArchDuke solves this issue by allowing team leaders to manage

. Team members

* ArchDuke allows users to assign tasks to team members, and track their workload, progress on tasks, and contributions.

. Tasks in a group project

* ArchDuke allows users to track multiple tasks within a project. Tasks can be created and assigned to members.
* ArchDuke tracks the deadlines and priority levels of tasks, to help the user organise which tasks should be assigned
and completed.

. Multiple group projects

* ArchDuke allows users to track multiple group projects. New group projects can be created and a default Kanban board will be created for users to start adding tasks.

|=======================================================================

== 1. Setting up

=== 1.1. Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above is required
. *IntelliJ* IDE is recommended
+
// [NOTE]
// IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
// Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== 1.2. Setting up the project environment on your local machine.

. Fork and clone the forked remote on your local machine.
. Launch IntelliJ (If you’re not on the IntelliJ Welcome screen please close your  existing project by going to `File` > `Close Project`.)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Structure for New Projects`
.. Under `Project Settings` Click on `Project`
.. Under `Project SDK` Click `New…` and point it to JDK 11 path.
.. Click `OK` to save the configuration
. Click `Import Project`
.  Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `Open`.
. Open the IntelliJ console/terminal and run the gradle command `gradlew processResource` on *Windows* or 
`./gradlew processResource` on *Mac/Linux*  (If you are encountered a permission error: `./gradlew: Permission denied` add the executable permission to the 
the shell script by running `chmod 744 gradlew` in your terminal)
It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. This will generate the resources required by the application and tests.

=== 1.3. Verifying the setup

. Run Duke to verify and try a few commands. (Refer here {insert link to the command page} the commands)
. Run the JUNIT Test/gradlew test command to ensure that all the test case passes.
// . <<Testing#,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

// === 1.4. Configurations to do before writing code

// ==== Configuring the coding style

// This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

// . Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
// . Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
// . Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

// * For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
// * For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

// Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

// ==== Setting up CI

// Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

// After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

// [NOTE]
// Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

// Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

// [NOTE]
// Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

// ==== Getting started with coding

// When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about <<DeveloperGuide#Design-Architecture, Duke's architecture>>.

== 2. Design

// === 2.1. Architecture

// .Architecture Diagram
// // image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

// The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

// `Main` talk about our main method here. (For reference only)

// * At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
// * At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

// *`Commons`* represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
// The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

// * `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

// The rest of the App consists of four main components.

// * *`UI`*: The UI of the App.
// * *`Logic`*: The command executor.
// * *`Model`*: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
// * *`Storage`*: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

// Each of the four components

// * Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
// * Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

// For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

// .Class Diagram of the Logic Component
// // image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

// [discrete]
// ==== How the architecture components interact with each other

// The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

// .Component interactions for `delete 1` command
// // image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

// The sections below give more details of each component.

// [[Design-Ui]]
// === 2.2. UI component

// .Structure of the UI Component
// image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

// *API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/views.ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

// The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

// The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/views.ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

// The `UI` component,

// * Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
// * Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

// [[Design-Logic]]
// === 2.3. Logic component

// [[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
// .Structure of the Logic Component
// image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

// *API* :
// link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

// [[Design-Model]]
// === 2.4. Model component

// .Structure of the Model Component
// image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

// *API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

// The `Model`,

// * stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
// * stores the Address Book data.
// * exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
// * does not depend on any of the other three components.

// [NOTE]
// As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
//  +
// image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

// [[Design-Storage]]
// === 2.5. Storage component

// .Structure of the Storage Component
// image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

// *API* : 
// link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

//The `Storage` component,

// * can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
// * can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

//[[Design-Commons]]
//=== 2.6. Common classes

//Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== 3. Implementation

// This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
// === 3.1. [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
// ==== Proposed Implementation

// The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
// It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
// Additionally, it implements the following operations:

// * `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
// * `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
// * `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

// These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

// Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

// Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

// image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

// Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

// image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

// Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

// image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

// [NOTE]
// If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

// Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

// image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

// [NOTE]
// If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

// The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

// image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

// NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

// The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

// [NOTE]
// If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

// Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

// image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

// Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

// image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

// The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

// image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

// ==== Design Considerations

// ===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

// * **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
// ** Pros: Easy to implement.
// ** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
// * **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
// ** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
// ** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

// ===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

// * **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
// ** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
// ** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
// * **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
// ** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
// ** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
// === 3.2. [Proposed] Data Encryption

// _{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

// === 3.3. Logging

// We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

// * The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
// * The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
// * Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

// *Logging Levels*

// * `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
// * `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
// * `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
// * `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

// [[Implementation-Configuration]]
// === 3.4. Configuration

// Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
