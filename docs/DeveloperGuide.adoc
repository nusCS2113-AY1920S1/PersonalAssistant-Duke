== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.


== Problem

The role of a team manager is to initiate, plan, design, execute and monitor the project to achieve its intended outcomes. This means the team manager must be able to efficiently organise and record down many details of the project to fulfill their responsibilities. However recording project details on pen and paper or word documents is too time consuming and lack many features that can aid in project management, such as deadline reminders.

== Target user profile

* has a need to manage complex projects
* leader of the team
* team manager
* prefer desktop apps over other types and prefer typing over mouse input
* is comfortable using CLI apps


== Value proposition
 The Team Manager application will enable the team manager to efficiently plan tasks, save time, and assign proper amount of tasks to team members, while providing an intuitive gui for them to visualise and easily keep track of the team progress.
 Users can use this app to manage projects faster than a typical mouse/gui driven app.
