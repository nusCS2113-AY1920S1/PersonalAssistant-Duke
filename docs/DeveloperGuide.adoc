== Introduction

Amateur musicians find it difficult to start with music theory as they are unable to see their work being shown in a
practical method and quit. Our application allows amateur musicians to learn music theory and apply their learning by
creating songs.

This application allows you to apply what you have learnt through:

* Ease of adding, deleting components to the songs

** The user is able to add, delete, edit and view components such as bars, notes, groups to the song so that they learn
the  basics of creating a song.

* Displaying the musical notes as sheets so that they can practice it in their favorite instrument.

** In the end once the user uses the application, they will be able to take away a pdf of their musical notes and also
print it in command line.

This document describes the coding style and the architecture of the Ducats project built by Team CS2113T F09-4.
This document is intended for our major release v1.4.

The documentat will allow any developer to start to work on the project by first learning about the system
architecture, then the implementation and lastly on how to document the code that is written.


== Setting up

To set up the program successfully, at minimum, JDK 11 is needed. IntelliJ Ultimate is the preferred IDE due to its ease in building the project. The steps to set up the project in your computer are as follows:

1. Fork the link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-4/main[Github repository] and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open Intellij (If you are not on the welcome screen, close the current project by navigating to *File* > *Close Project*.
3. Setup the correct JDK version:
.. Click *Configure* > *Structure* for new projects.
.. Under *Project Settings* click on *Project*.
.. Under *Project SDK* click *New* and point it to JDK 11 path.
.. Click *OK* to save the configuration.
4. Run the Project by editing the run configuration to point to
Ducats.java as the main class.

== Design

This section describes the design of Ducats, starting with the overall architecture, and then proceeding to the a more detailed view of the major components.

=== Overall Architecture

Ducats consists of multiple components implemented as objects that work together to fulfill the program's objectives. Figure 1 below showcases the high-level architecture of Ducats:

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture_Diagram.png[]


Ducats, the main class, is responsible for the initialization of the different components, as well as the highest level of logic.

DucatsLogger is a common class used by many of the components in order to log information, warnings and errors in a `.log` file.

Other than the two components mentioned above, the rest of the components are linked in a way reminiscent of an n-tier architectural style, with the higher-level components making use of the services provided by the lower-level components. The remaining seven components are as follows:

* `UI`: interacts with the console (reading and writing)
* `Parser`: parses the input command and creates of the appropriate Command object
* `WordGetter`: suggests the correct command to the user if the user misspells his command
* `Command`: executed to modify the UI, SongList and Storage
* `SongList`: contains the list of Song objects
* `Metronome`: displays a visual metronome on screen when initialized through a `MetronomeCommand`
* `StorageParser`: parses data in persistent storage and converts song data to a form friendly to be stored in persistent storage
* `Storage`: Reads data from and writes data to persistent storage in the hard disk

Each of these classes have their API illustrated in their respective files.

=== UI

*API*: link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/ducats/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

This layer consists of the `UI` Class which is in charge of printing the output to the command line in a specific format. This was chosen instead of printing the output from every individual class as we opted to do abstraction to make it simpler when adding new features. This class also receives messages from users and passes them to the parser layer, which decides which class to be called.

=== Parser and Commands

This layer consists of the `Parser` Class. This layer takes the message from the `UI` Class and then processes it to check through the list of commands and call the constructor of the required class. The `Parser` Class calls the `WordGetter` Class (Autocorrect class) to get the closest command to the users input as to account for typos. It achieves this by splitting the input or throwing a Duke Exception if the user did not enter the command properly. 

=== AutoCorrect 

This layer consists of the `WordGetter` Class, which works on the basis of the Jaccard theorem that finds the intersection between the 2 words and divides it by the union of the 2 words and hence gets the word with the highest ratio and is above a threshold as to account for random inputs. 

=== SongList

=== Storage and StorageParser

*Storage API*: link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/ducats/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

*StorageParser API*: link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/ducats/StorageParser.java[`StorageParser.java`]

The Storage layer, implemented by the `Storage` class, is responsible for Ducats' interaction with persistent storage of the SongList, which is in the form of a directory called *data* containing `.txt` files that each contain the full data for one Song.

The StorageParser layer's purpose is to parse the data found within the persistent storage, as well as to convert the data found within the SongList to a human-readable, storage-friendly form. This layer is implemented by the `StorageParser` class.

== Implementation

This section describes in detail the implementation of the various features, as well as how the different components interact with each other.

=== Command Parsing and Execution

Since Ducats is a CLI app, it works by reading user input and carrying out the command the user wants it to execute. In line with this objective, the different components of Ducats have been designed to interact in the sequence as depicted by Figure X.

.Command Parsing and Execution Sequence Diagram
image::Command_Sequence_Diagram.png[]

In the above diagram, 'XYZ' is used to represent a general command or function. There are several different types of possible commands that can be created after parsing, and hence the object is labelled "XYZCommand". Similarly, to format the output string, there are multiple method within the UI class of doing so, hence being represented here by "XYZFormat()".

It can be seen that, for all commands, the `Parser` class is used to determine what type of command the user intends for the program to execute, and then creates the appropriate command with the full message text as a parameter. Then, the `execute()` method of the Command is called, modifying the `SongList` and `Storage`, and returning a String to be displayed on the console through the `UI` class.

A slightly different schedule is used for the Metronome functionality, which will be discussed in further detail in Section 4.5.

=== Basic CRUD

CRUD stands for "Create, Read, Update, Delete", and this framework serves as the most essential part of any data-driven software. In Ducats, basic CRUD functionality is implemented, alongside more sophisticated features such as the ability to Undo and Redo.

==== Creating a Song and Navigation

The creation of a new song is straightforward. In the `new` command, the following attributes of the song to be created will be specified:

* name
* key _[implementation coming in v2.0]_
* time signature _[implementation coming in v2.0]_

While the above data is stored with every song, data adjustments based on, and specific methods that utilize the key and time signature are yet to be implemented.

The created Song object will then be inserted into the SongList object, which contains all the song data of Ducats. Following this, persistent storage will be updated.

In order to enable the modification of certain songs when there are multiple songs without the forced provision of additional parameters by the user, a system of navigation has been implemented, where a song can be "opened" in order for it to be edited, with the first song in the SongList being "opened" by default. "Opening" a song is carried out by the execution of the `OpenCommand`, which changes a variable in the `SongList` object known as the `activeIndex`.

`activeIndex` corresponds to the index of the song that can be edited by the other CRUD functions, and only by modifying this attribute to the appropriate value can songs other than the first one be editable. For example, consider the situation where the SongList contains two songs titled "twinkle" and "dreams".

image::songlist_activeIndex1.png[]

In this case, as the default `activeIndex` is set to `0`, the user can enter `open dreams` in the CLI to make sure he is editing the song titled "dreams".

image::songlist_activeIndex2.png[]

When the main class executes the command, the command will first try to find the index of the provided song in the song list.

    String songName = message.substring(5);
    int songIndex = songList.findSongIndex(songName);

findSongIndex(songName) conducts a linear search on the SongList to return the index of the song that has the given name, and returns -1 is the song is not found. By querying the return value, Ducats either sets the activeIndex of the SongList or throws and then handles a DucatsException. The former is carried out with the `setActiveIndex()` method of the SongList class.

    songList.setActiveIndex(songList.findSongIndex(songName));

For future CRUD commands, the specific SongList method invoked by the `execute()` method takes in the activeIndex as a parameter and proceeds to perform the necessary operations on the SongList, as shown below. This means that you can utilize the SongList API function `setActiveIndex()` in other created components to achieve the same functionality.

image::songlist_activeIndex3.png[]

_Design Considerations_:

* Use binary search instead of linear search for `findSongIndex()`
** _Pros_: Higher efficiency in navigation
** _Cons_: the `list` in the SongList needs to be sorted, and insertion in a sorted manner, along with the implementation of binary search, for minimal gains in efficiency, seems to violate KISS

* Let the user input the index of the song rather than the name
** _Pros_: Faster input of command for the user, no need for `findSongIndex()`
** _Cons_: User needs to look at the full list first, so overall, time is not saved. For the user, querying a name is more natural than an index.

Hence, we have decided to go for a linear search for `findSongIndex()`, and let the user input the song name to open the song instead of the index.

==== Modifying a Song

=== Advanced CRUD

==== Undo/Redo

UndoCommand and RedoCommand is implemented using a typical undo-redo stack, which is also a important component called `UndoRedoStack`, which records all the versions of the `SongList` object that the user is currently using.
The implementation of UndoRedoStack is similar to git history tree.
Each node on the UndoRedoStack is a version of the SongList.

Once the user enters a command that may change the SongList, the UndoRedoStack will make one step forward, which is similar to 'git commit'.

Before each `undo` or `redo`, UndoRedoStack will check the undoability/redoability of the UndoRedoStack.

* `undo` - `canUndo()`:
** If the tree is at the very first version, then cannot undo anymore.
** Else, the UndoRedoStack can be undone.

* `redo` - `canRedo()`:
** If the tree is at the very last version, then cannot redo anymore.
** Else, the UndoRedoStack can be redone.

Impact of UndoCommand/RedoCommand:

* `undo` - moves the UndoRedoStack to its previous version.
* `redo` - moves the UndoRedoStack to its next version.

Note that after user enters a command that could change the SongList, if the current version of SongList is not the latest version, which means the the UndoRedoStack is not at its latest node,
all the nodes after current node will be dropped, and the new version of the UndoRedoStack will be treated as the current and the latest node,
and you cannot visit the previous branch of nodes anymore.

==== Overlay
For any musician, having the freedom to overlay a part of one song to another (overlaps two components and we play the 2 components together at the same time)  will save them a lot of time and also make it easier for them to create a composition. The overlay function aims to perform this functionality and allows the freedom to overlay a bar-bar, bar-group, group - group. 

image::overlay_demo.png[]

`overlay`: 

`overlay <bar_num to be overlayed> <bar_num to be overlayed to>`

Allows the users to overlay a bar from the same song to another bar on the same song. This feature is really useful when the song is really big and we just need to get the index of the bars to be overlayed and the overlaying bar. 

*How to go about it?* 

The `overlay` command gets the command from the Parser and checks if all the required parameters are provided by spliting the string by spaces. For instance if the user inputs 1 number instead of 2, then a DucatsException is thrown. 

The index of the current Song is obtained by calling the `getActiveIndex()` function of SongList. 

    songList.getActiveIndex();

After which the required song is obtained by calling the `getSongIndex(songIndex)` function of SongList: 

    songList.getSongIndex(songIndex);

The list of bars of the song are obtained by calling the getter function 

    song.getBars(); 

After which, we try to get the bar depending on the user's input (user's input - 1 because in Ducats we use a 1 based indexing) 

We make a copy of the overlayingBar by calling the `copy` function of the bar. 

    Bar.copy(bar_to_be_copied); 

This function returns a bar and hence allows us to pass the bar by value rather than reference. Therefore,any modification does not affect the overlaying bar. 

We create a `Combiner` class, which combines 2 same components of a song. 

    combiner = new Combiner(); 

After creating the combiner, we check if there is any 3rd parameter (`repeat`) to repeat the overlaying throughout the song from the bar that needs to be overlayed to.



If there is a `repeat` parameter, we will call the `repeatLoop` function. This uses an iterator to loop through the array of bars. An iterator was used as it allows us to modify the object in the array while looping through it. The current index of the loop is stored in the form of a variable.

If the condition is fulfilled,  we call the combiner's `combineBar` function.

    combiner.combineBar(Bar_to_be_combined_on, Bar_to_be_combined_to);

We repeat this process till the end of the array list. 

If there is no repeat function, then we just get the bar to be overlayed from the array and call the combiner's `combineBar` function. 

After which, we call the `updatefile` function of storage to store the new song and then return the string from the `execute` function of ascii to properly display the new song to the user through the UI. Below is the sequence diagram for the overlay function: 


image::overlaysequencediagram.png[]

==== overlay_bar_song


`overlay_bar_song`: 

`overlay_bar_song <song_name to be overlayed from> <bar_number> <song_name to be overlayed to> <bar_number>`
 
Allows the users to overlay a bar from a different song to another bar from another song. This especially useful when the composer has already made a song or liked a part of a song from another composer. 


*How to go about it?* 


The command is sent from the parser class and appropriate checking of the command is done to check if the user has inputed the right number of parameters by splitting the message space by a ` `.


This command allows the user to input the song name rather than by index and hence once the command message has been split. The splitting is performed by the  `message.split(" ")`. 

The exact song is obtained by calling the `findSong` function of songList. If the array sent by songList is smaller than 1, then the song doesnt exists and a Ducats exception is thrown. 

    songList.findSong(songName); 

The respective bar array is obtained by calling the `getBars()` function for each song obtained and the combiner class is invoked. 

If there is a repeat parameter, we will call the `repeatLoop` function. This uses an iterator is used to loop through the bar list and check if the current index is greater than or equal to the required index and perform the combineBar function, which splits each bar into chords and combines the chords using the arrayList combination. 

If there isnt a repeat parameter,then we just get the bar to be overlayed from the array and call the combiner's combineBar() function. 

After which, we call the updatefile function of storage to store the new song and then return the string from the execute function of ascii to properly display the new song to the user through the UI. 

Below is the action sequence diagram: 


image::overlay_bar_song_actionsequence.png[]

==== overlay_group_group

`overlay_group_group`: 

`overlay_group_group <song_name to be overlayed from> <group_number> <song_name to be overlayed to> <group_number>` 


Allows the users to overlay a group from one song to another. The interesting aspect of this feature is that it allows the users to overlay groups of unequal length, i.e. a group with a larger number of bars onto a group with a smaller number of bars and vice versa. The following example shows what will happen when combining two unequal groups:  


* Group 1: {Bar X Bar Y} 
* Group 2 : {Bar A Bar B Bar C Bar D}
* Overlaying Group 1 onto Group 2:  { [Bar A + Bar X] [Bar B + Bar Y] [Bar C + Bar X] [Bar D + Bar Y]}   
* Overlaying Group 2 onto Group 1: { [Bar A + Bar X] [Bar B + Bar Y]} 

It works similarly to the above two commands but the only difference is the way it handles unequal groups as it gets ratio of the two groups (i.e. the number of bars in group_1): 

    int numberOfTimes = (int) Math.ceil(barCopiedTo.size() / (barBeCopiedFrom.size() * 1.0));

The value is rounded up using the `Math.ceil` function as this gives us the upper bound for the number of times the barBeCopiedFrom needs to be repeated. After which we loop through the tobeCopiedFrom array and combine it with the toCopiedTo bars. A variable is used to keep count to ensure one doesnt access. 


==== overlay_bar_group 


Allows the users to overlay a  bar onto a group from the same song. It works in the similar way as the `overlay` commands. The repeat parameter allows the user to overlay through all the groups from the specified starting group. 

`overlay_bar_group <bar_number> <group_number>`

The group number can be obtained from the `list_group` function. 


==== Group and Copy

=== Display

=== Metronome

A metronome is a device that outputs sound at regular, adjustable intervals, commonly used by musicians to more easily play at a particular tempo. In Ducats, the main purpose of the Metronome functionality (accessed through `MetronomeCommand`) is to provide a visual presentation of a particular tempo and time signature, so that the user can more easily understand what an appropriate tempo for their song would be.

Due to a reliance on multi-threading through the Timer library, the execution of the functionality is not carried out in the `UI` task, whose primary purpose is to display and read console content. Instead, a `Metronome` object is initialized in the main class, and `MetronomeCommand` will provide the object with the following parameters:

* duration (in bars)
* tempo (in BPM)
* time signature

Following this, the `TimerTask` of generating the appropriate output to the console will be executed by a new `Timer` object initialized in the `start()` method of the `Metronome` object. The overall sequence diagram can be seen in Figure X.

<insert seq diagram specific to Metronome>

=== Autosuggest

This feature was built to ensure that the system can autocorrect for minor mistakes while typing the commands such as helo instead of help. There is no need to call a command to get the closest command but rather it will automatically try to understand the command that is being typed. 

image::autosuggest.png[]


The feature works on the basis of the Jaccard theorem that finds the intersection between the 2 words and divides it by the union of the 2 words and hence gets the word with the highest ratio and is above a threshold as to account for random inputs. The intersection function is a custom function and uses hashmaps to keep count of the number of common alphabets between the 2 commands. Hahsmaps were choosen to help increase the efficiency. 


=== Storage and StorageParser

In order to ensure that the songs the user has created, deleted or modified can be retrieved even after exiting Ducats, a form of persistent storage is needed. This is implemented as a folder containing `.txt` files, and a `Storage` class that will interact with the said folder to read and modify its contents. Since the `Storage` class can create and modify files, it is important to understand the exact procedures executed within the class for the reading and writing of files. The two swimlane diagrams below display the sequence of events, as well as how the `Storage` class interacts with the `StorageParser` class. Each activity is annotated with the function within which it occurs for easy reference.

.Reading files (for each file)
image::storage_read.png[]

Before reading from the files, an assertion is made for the file list of the data folder (obtained through the `File.listFiles()` method) to not be null. The reading process as described in Figure X is then repeated for each file in the file list.

.Writing to files (for each song)
image::storage_write.png[]

Regardless of whether the `.txt` file corresponding to the specific song exists, the `Storage` class will attempt the creation of the file to ensure its existence. Due to the modification of data being involved, changes to the files are logged by DucatsLogger.

_Data Format:_

In order to convert each Song object to a human-readable String, and to be able to parse it back, a format must be decided for the storing of the Song object in persistent storage. The following format has been adopted:

    NAME KEY TEMPO
    BAR_1
    BAR_2
    ...
    BAR_N
    groups:
    GROUP_1_NAME BAR_1 ... BAR_N
    ...
    GROUP_N_NAME BAR_1 ... BAR_N

Each `BAR_N`, where N is a positive integer, is formatted as follows, with the segments representing each individual bar, chord and note being labelled with B, C and N respectively:

    [[UAs;UCs],[UA;UC],[UA;UC],[UA;UC],[MCs;LDs],[MC;LD],[MC;UDs],[MC,UD]]
    |----------------------------------B---------------------------------|
     |---C---|
      |N|

For each String representing a Note object, the first two characters correspond to the pitch (ranging from Pitch.LOWER_C to Pitch.UPPER_C while passing through Pitch.MIDDLE_C). An exception for this convention would be Rest, which is represented as “RT”. The “s”, if present, signifies that the unit Note that has the duration of a 1⁄8 note is the start of a bigger Note object or one of the same duration. For example, in the above visualization, the Bar consists of an Upper A Note with the duration of ½ and an Upper C Note with the same duration in the first four chords.

By implementing the storage in this way, we are able to ensure that the data is both storage-friendly as well as human-readable and editable. To construct the data to be stored in the .txt file, the `StorageParser` class invokes the toString() methods for the Song, Bar, Chord and Note classes for each Song in the Song list in a tree-like fashion due to the composition structure of the Song component (as can be seen in Figure X). Inversely, in order for the StorageParser class to parse the data found in the .txt file into Song objects that are to be stored in the SongList, the following methods are defined under the `StorageParser` class:

* `convertNoteFromString(String s)` (converts a String into a Note)
* `convertChordFromString(String s)` (converts a String into a Chord) _(uses the above)_
* `convertBarFromString(String s)` (converts a String into a Bar) _(uses the above)_
* `convertSongFromString(String s)` (converts a String into a Song) _(uses the above)_

_Design Considerations_:

* Using a single .txt file to store all the data
** _Pros_: easier implementation of `Storage`
** _Cons_: harder for the user to import and export files without corrupting the data, complicated parsing in `StorageParser` required to get the full data, hard for the user to view the data if the song is too long due to line length limits on most `.txt` file editors
* Using .csv files instead of .txt files to store the data
** _Pros_: arguably a more organized method of data management
** _Cons_: difficult to store song data of varying lengths in a meaningful way that would make a `.csv` file more ideal than a `.txt` file

We have decided to use a storage directory that contains `.txt` files, each containing a single song's data. With this implementation, it is easy for the user to export and import songs by just copying out or inserting .txt files of the same format respectively. Additionally, having a folder instead of a single file is neater for the user's file management, hence enhancing the user experience.

=== Logging

== Adding a New Function

When creating a new command for Ducats, one must first create a class separately for this command. This class must extend the abstract class Command.  One must also implement the method execute which is in charge of executing the command depending on the user’s input. Furthermore, the parser class must be changed to include the command, by editing the switch case. It should also be included in the Ducats class’s run method. It can be included by using c instance of <Class Name> .If the undo-redo function is not applicable to the implemented command, then it must be included the nested if statement in the code (Refer to Fig 1.3) . Furthermore the command must be included in the  WordGetter class’s commandList array of String (Fig 1.4 for more details).
