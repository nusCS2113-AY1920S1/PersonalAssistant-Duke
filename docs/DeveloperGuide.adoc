== Introduction
=== Purpose

This document illustrates on the architecture designs and the software decisions implemented for the desktop application D2. Duke 2.0 (D2), or Duke Jr.? is a desktop application which enables the prospective applicants of NUS Faculty of Engineering to better plan out their university life. It is an extended task manager, which not only allows for prospective applicants to manage their deadlines and events pertaining to the freshman orientations and document submission, but also provides a coherent and concise platform to compare two engineering degrees of their choice and explore many other details related to the degree. Students can also create lists of engineering degrees of their choice and update it as per their choice. The developer guide will provide you with information such as an overall view of the system hierarchy, logical view of the system’s components, and a process view of the system’s communications that will enable you to help contribute to it too. 

=== Scope

This document describes the software architecture and various other software decisions undertaken for the implementation of D2. The intended audience of this document are developers, designers, software testers of D2 and for those who wish to modify the source files to fit for their own purposes. You may also have a look at it if you wish to understand how this application works.

== Setting Up
=== Prerequisites
While Duke 2.0 may work using diffferent versions of Java and with other IDEs, the following are recommended because they have been used for testing:

* Java Development Kit '11'
* Intellij IDE

=== Setup on local Computer


*Manual Import:*

. `Fork` this Repository and `Clone` your remote repository locally to your computer
. Open *Intellij IDE* and set up JDK `11`
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` > `JDK` and select the path of the installed JDK `11`
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate project directory of the cloned repository
. Click `Next`
. Ensure that the `src folder` is checked ✅, and Click `Next` until the `Finish` button appears
. Click the `Finish` button


*Automatic Import using Intellij Check Out:*

. `Fork` this Repository
. Open *Intellij IDE* and set up JDK `11`
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` > `JDK` and select the path of the installed JDK `11`
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Check out from Version Control` > `Git`
. Enter URL of your remote repository > Click `Clone`
. Wait for Intellij to Set Up the project


=== Verifying Setup
. Ensure that Gradle has been imported by running `src/java/javafx/Launcher.java`
. Test out basic Duke 2.0 commands by referring to the User Guide

== Design


== Implementation
=== Undo/Redo Feature
==== Implementation
(Images to be added later)

The undo/redo mechanism is done using a simplified memento pattern, since the command classes have already been implemented. This works as an extension of the command classes and makes use of existing code without any 3rd party libraries or additional dependencies.

Each command that modifies the task or degree lists saves the complete previous state within itself as a `memento` class. Thus, when we call this command's `memento`, we can "unexecute" the command and get the complete state of the task or degree list before it was modified by the `command`. 

All of these commands are stored in a `commandList` stack, where it will be used to retrieve the latest `command` whenever undo is input, or to be manually retrieve a particular command using `undoRedoPointer` whenever redo is input.

==== Design Considerations
How undo/redo executes:

* Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Commands saves a complete previous state if it modifies the degrees or task list
** Pros: 
*** Much easier to implement than a partial state save. 
*** Easier to implement when new commands are added.
*** Common method in the industry to implement undo/redo.
** Cons: 
*** Memory issues once too many commands are executed.
* Alternative 2: Saves the degree and task list to a history.
** Pros: 
*** Straightforward method to save previous states that can be called using undo/redo. 
*** No work needed when new commands are added.
** Cons: 
*** Does not work when a modification changes multiple lists.
*** Memory issues once too many states are saved.
* Alternative 3: Perform the opposite command whenever undo is called. (i.e. undoing add will delete the addition instead of recalling the previous state)
** Pros: 
*** Uses less memory than saving the state every time. 
*** Proper implementation of the memento pattern.
** Cons: 
*** A lot of work needed to "unexecute" every command possible. 
*** More commands means more "unexecution" is needed, and the workload scales higher than alternative 1.

Data Structure to support undo/redo:

* Alternative 1 (Current Choice): `CommandList` class using a stack and a pointer.
** Pros:
*** Much faster pushing and popping the stack than adding into standard `Lists` and `ArrayLists`.
*** More control than a simple stack, as it can also support redos and new commands added after undos.
** Cons:
*** Have to manually the CommandList from scratch instead of using a pre-esxisting data structure or class.

* Alternative 2: `ArrayList` of commands and a pointer.
** Pros:
*** Less work needed to write methods as it uses a pre-existing data structure.
*** Easier for newer developers to understand how the undo/redo function works.
** Cons:
*** Have to do all the work of adding, removing and choosing commands within another class, and can result in messy implementations.
*** Slightly slower than stacks when adding and deleting elements in the `ArrayList`.
