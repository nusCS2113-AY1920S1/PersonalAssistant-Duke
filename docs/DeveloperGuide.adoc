== Introduction

=== About AlphaNUS

NUS treasurers often come face to face with piles of payment forms filled with payments for claims and also need to
keep track of their statuses. Having to manage and allocate club funds to multiple projects, treasurers
may find it a chore to keep up to date with their finances.

*AlphaNUS* is a financial management assistant for treasurers to keep track of payment forms made by payees as well as manage the club's funds for projects.

This developer guide includes detailed documentation on the designs and implementations of the project and how developers can make changes it.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

== Design
.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above displays the n-tier architecture design of the AlphaNUS. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Command,*`Command`*>>: The command executor and parser.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

The UI solely consists of a `Ui` object that is initiated at the start of the program.

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Command` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Command]]
=== Command component

.Structure of the Command Component
image::CommandClassDiagram.png[]

The `Command` component consists of:

* `Parser` to make sense of user input.
* `Instruction` to determine which process to execute.
* `Process` to process the execution of the command.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component
[[fig-ModelClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

.  Both `Project Manager` and `Payment Manager` takes in user command from `Command`.
.  The `Project Manager` class manages a HashMap of `Project` objects.
.  Each `Project` object contains a `Budget` and a HashMap of `Payee` objects.
.  Each `Payee` object contains an ArrayList of `Payments` objects.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `Project` object by `PaymentManager` and passed back to `Command`.

[[Design-Storage]]

== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


=== Project Feature
The `project` feature is managed by the `ProjectManager` class, which is called by the
`Process` class in the `Command` component.

This feature supports the following commands:

* `add project pr/PROJECT_NAME` -- Adds a new project to the record.
* `delete project pr/PROJECT_NAME` -- Deletes a project from the record.
* `goto project pr/PROJECT_NAME` -- Go to a project in the record.
* `list project` -- Lists all projects in the record.

A detailed explanation of the use case for the `add project` command is given below to demonstrate how each component interacts with each other.

1. User executes the command `add project pr/RAG` in the CLI. This input is passed from the `Ui` to `Command` where the input will be parsed to determine the command to execute.

2. The `Command` component will process the `add project` command and execute it in the `Model` component, calling `ProjectManager` to add a new `Project` object with the user defined `PROJECT_NAME` to its HashMap of `Project` objects.

3. `ProjectManager` then returns a value of the newly created `Project` object to `Command` which is passed to `Ui` for printing the project details to the user.

Below is a sequence diagram to provide a visual representation of the `add project` command.

[[fig-AddProjectSeqDiagram]]
.Sequence Diagram of the add project command
image::AddProjectSeqDiagram.png[]

The `delete project` command is implemented in the same manner to the `add project` command. Both return the `Project` object that was deleted or added to be passed to `Ui` for printing its details to the user. The `delete project` command only differs from the `add project` command when it deletes the `Project` object from the HashMap of `Project` objects, in contrast to adding a `Project` object to the HashMap.

// end::Project[]

//tag::payee
=== Payee Feature
==== Payee Class
The `Payee` Class object holds all information regarding the identity of the payee, as well as an ArrayList `payments` of `Payment` objects.
When a new `Payee` object is created, it is stored in the respective HashMap `managerMap` for the specific project the payee is being paid for. +
The following are the class members storing the payee's identity information.

** Project Name : `project`
** Payee Name : `name`
** Email Address : `email`
** Matriculation Number : `matricNum`
** Phone Number : `phoneNum`

==== Payments Class
The `Payments` Class object stores the details of the payment being made. A `Payments` object once constructed will be added to the ArrayList `payments` member of the specified payee the payment is being made to.
The following are the class members storing the payment's details.

** Project : `project`
** Payee Name : `name`
** Description of Payment : `item`
** Amount being paid : `cost`
** Invoice Number : `inv`
** Due date for payment : `deadline`

Note that the due date is automatically set to 30 days after the creation of the `Payments` object.

==== Field and Status Enums
The feature is also supported by 2 enum objects, `Field`; +

** PAYEE
** EMAIL
** MATRIC
** PHONE
** ITEM
** COST
** INVOICE
** DEADLINE
** STATUS

and `Status`: +

** PENDING
** APPROVED
** OVERDUE

==== Payee Feature Commands
The payee feature supports the following commands:

* `add payee p/name e/email m/matricNum ph/phoneNum` -- Adds a new payee to the record.
* `add payment p/name i/item c/cost v/inv` -- Adds a new payee to the record.
* `delete payee p/name` -- Deletes a payee from the record.
* `delete payment p/name v/inv` -- Deletes a payment from the record.
* `edit p/name f/field r/replacement` -- Edits data for an existing payee in the record.
* `find payee p/name` -- Finds details of a specified payee in the record, across all projects.
* `find payment p/name i/item` -- Finds details of a specified payment in the record, across all projects.
* `list payments` -- Lists all payments for the current project in the record.
* `list payments pr/name` -- Lists all payments for specified project in the record.
* `list payments p/name` -- Lists all payments for specified payee in the record.

==== PaymentManager
The `PaymentManager` is an abstract class that is subclassed in the payments package, which contains the `Payee` and `Payments` classes. It serves to process the input from the `Command` package and implement the payee feature commands (Section 4.2.4). The `PaymentManager` class implements the following methods:

* PaymentManager#addPayee
* PaymentManager#addPayments
* PaymentManager#deletePayee
* PaymentManager#deletePayments
* PaymentManager#editPayee
* PaymentManager#findPayee
* PaymentManager#checkStatus

[[fig-AddPayeeSeqDiagram]]
.Sequence Diagram of the add payee command
image::AddPayeeSeqDiagram.png[]

A detailed explanation of the use case for the add payee command is given below to demonstrate how each component interacts with each other. +
1. User executes the command `add payee p/name e/email m/matricNum ph/phoneNum` in the CLI. This input is passed from the Ui to Parser where the input will be parsed to determine the command to execute. It then invokes Process, which splits the user input and breaks down the user's intended answer into information our classes can interact with. +
2. The PaymentManager is invoked, and in this case, the addPayee method is called. The method checks which project is currently selected and constructs a new Payee object. The Payee object is pushed into the current project's managerMap, a HashMap of all the project's payees. +
3. Assuming a valid input was passed from the user, a confirmation message showing the summary of the details of the newly created Payee would be printed. Else, an error will prompt the user to try again and provide the correct template for the command they attempted. In Process, most of the Exception handling is done to catch all possible user error cases. +

The Payment Manager handles most other commands the same way, given that all payee information is stored within a single project LinkedHashMap, and all payment information is stored in an ArrayList in each Payee. The only method in Payment Manger that is different is the helper function 

=== History Feature
The `history` feature is implemented to keep track of the list of all input commands entered by the user. It is facilitated by the `Storage` class which is called by the `Process` class in the `command` component.

This feature supports the following commands:

* `history` - lists all the input commands(with the date and time beside) entered by the user.
* `view history h/DATE_1 to DATE_2` - lists the input commands entered by the user during a certain period.
* (proposed) `delete history h/DATE_1 to DATE_2` - deletes the input commands entered by the user during a certain period.

The use case for the `history` command is given below to show how each component interacts with each other.

1. The user executes the `history` command in the CLI. The input is passed from `Ui` to `command` to determine the command to execute.

2. The `Command` component will process the `history` command and load the txt file consisting the input commands from the `Storage` class into an arraylist.

3. This arraylist is passed to `Ui` for printing the list of input commands, along with the date and time it was entered, to the user.

Below is the sequence diagram showing the interactions between the different components used to implement the `history` command.

image::sequenceDiagramforHistory.PNG[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How `view history h/DATE to DATE` is implemented
* Alternative 1: The application loops through the arraylist of all the input commands loaded from the txt file in storage. In the for loop, it is checked if the date beside the command is within the date range provided in the input. If yes, then it is added to a new arraylist, which is printed once the application has gone through the for loop.
