== Introduction
Optix is a desktop application for users to manage ticket booking and the finances of a show at its respective venue.
User input is done mainly using the Command Line Interface (CLI) and GUI is used to display the output. The CLI and GUI
are integrated to make the execution of commands more efficient and user-friendly.

This document describes the architecture and system design of Optix and serves to let other developers understand the
implementation of the program should they wish to work on it. This document is divided into four
parts: System architecture, implementations, functionalities of the program and requirements of the program.

*Problem we are solving*: +
Provide an open-source software for planning committees who wish to schedule shows at a venue but lack proper
management system. Optix is also an all-in-one platform that allows for seat bookings and finance tracking.

=== Target User Profile:
* Any user with a need to track the seat booking of a show or event as well as the finances from the bookings.
* Prefers CLI to mouse input.

=== Product features:
* New shows scheduled can be added to the list.
* Sales of seats for a show.
* Program is designed to price the seats according to the different tiers.
* Revenue earned from a show can be calculated based on the seats booked.

=== Value proposition:
Many planning committees often plan performances and events at various venues for guests. However, as many of them do
not have access to ticket management programs, they use conventional methods like using Microsoft Excel to record seat
purchases and track finances. Such tracking methods are rather inefficient and error prone as it is difficult to check
if a particular seat has been purchased or not. Optix is an all-in-one application that facilitates the management of
seats and finances of  a show more efficiently than an average GUI-based app. Users can easily track the seating
arrangement with the GUI and sell seats to customers efficiently through the CLI. An in-built finance tracker also
helps to track the profit earned from the shows.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites
. *JDK* `11` or above +
. *IntelliJ* IDE

[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. Do not disable them.
If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project
. Fork link:{repoURL}[this] repo, and clone the fork to your computer. +
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project
dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New…` find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.

=== Verifying the setup
. Run Main and try a few commands.
. Run the tests(To hyperlink to test portion later on) to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

== Design

This section documents the system architecture for Optix and noteworthy components that supports Optix.

=== Architecture

image::images/devguide/DG_SystemArch.png[width ="600", align="center"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick
overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes named `Main` and `MainApp`. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initialize the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

The rest of the App consists of 3 components.

* `GUI`: The Graphical User Interface of the App.
* `Optix`: The intermediary between `GUI` and `Command`.
* `XYZCommand`: Various Commands that changes data in `Model`.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where user issues the command
`list Nov 2020`

image::images/devguide/DG_Design_SequenceDiagram.png[width ="600", align="center"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== GUI Component

image::images/devguide/DG_GUI_ClassDiagram.png[width ="600", align="center"]

API: `Link for GUI.files`

The `GUI` consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g `DialogBox`, `HelpWindow`, `SeatDisplayController`, etc.
`MainWindow` is split into two segment, on the left the display window and on the right the chat box, as show
in the GUI diagram.

image::images/UI.png[width ="600", align="center"]

The display window consists of 5 different viewing mode.

* *Shows*: Scheduled shows for the event venue. Controlled by `ShowController`.
* *Seats*: The seat availability for a specific show. Controlled by `SeatDisplayController`.
* *Finance*: The projected revenue for scheduled shows. Controlled by `FinanceController`.
* *Archive*: The total revenue for a show that has been performed. Controlled by `FinanceController`.
* *Help*: All possible command to operate Optix. Controlled by `HelpWindow`.

The `GUI` component uses JavaFx UI framework and JFoenix API. The layout of these UI parts are defined in
matching .fxml files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
`MainWindow` is specified in `MainWindow.fxml`.

The `GUI` component,

* Passes user command to `Optix` component to be executed.

* Listens for changes in `Model` in `Optix` so that the GUI can be updated with the modified data.

=== Optix Component

API: `Link for Optix file`

`Optix` is the backend software that acts as the intermediary between `GUI` and `Command` logic.
`Optix`,

* Instantiates `Command` through `Parser` based on user command in `GUI`.
* Passes updated model to be displayed by `GUI`.
* Holds all the file path for `Storage`.
* Stores `Optix` response to user.

The sections below give more details of each component in `Optix`.

==== Model Component

API: `Link for Model file`

`Model` stores the data used for the App. It contains 3 `ShowMap`.

1. *shows*: All the shows that are scheduled for the future.
2. *showsHistory*: All the shows that are in the past.
3. *showsGui*: All the shows that are to be displayed on the `GUI` component.

image::images/devguide/DG_Model_ClassDiagram.png[width ="600", align="center"]

The ShowMap Class Diagram shown is the structure for all ShowMap with the exception of *showsHistory*.
For *showsHistory* the multiplicity of Seat is 0 as it is irrelevant.

==== Storage Component

API: `Link for Storage file`

`Storage` reads and writes to its respective .txt files so that information can be loaded on the
following app launch. The .txt files are saved in `{currDir}/src/main/data`. There is a total of 2
.txt files that are written and read in `Storage` component.

1. optix.txt

2. archive.txt

==== UI Component

API: `Link for UI file`

The `UI` component handles all of `Optix` response. `Optix` response is determined by `Command` component
and subsequently displayed using `GUI` component.

==== Parser Component

API: `Link for Parser file`

The `Parser`,

* Determines the command word and constructs `Command` component.
* Stores command aliases in a HashMap.
* Updates command aliases in the HashMap.
* Reads and writes to parserPreferences.txt.

=== Command Component

API: `Link for Command folder`

All commands found in commands package extends `Command`. The `Command` for the different data structures
are stored under different subpackages. Currently the commands package consists of 4 different subpackages.

* *shows*: Commands that deal with the management fo shows for the theatre.
* *seats*: Commands that deal with the management of seats within the theatre.
* *finance*: Commands that manage finances within the theatre.
* *parser*: Commands that deal with command aliases.


== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== [Proposed] View Monthly Revenue Feature
Allows user to view their profit for a specific month.

==== Proposed Implementation
Viewing the monthly revenue is executed by the `ViewMonthlyCommand`, which extends from the abstract class `Command` and
is stored under the commands package. +
Additionally, it implements the following operations based on the query date:

* Model#findMonthly() -- Retrieves the list of shows in the month specified by the input.
* Model#getShows() -- Retrieves the current list of shows should the user query be in the future.
* Model#getShowshistory() -- Retrieves the archive list should the user query be in the past.
* OptixDateFormatter#getMonth() -- get the integer value of the month.
* OptixDateFormatter#getYear() -- get the integer value of the year.
* Theatre#getProfit() -- get the profit earned for the show.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the `ViewMonthlyCommand` at each step.

*Step 1* +
The user starts the application. `Storage` will be initialised with the saved contents from previous runs. `Model`
will then be initialised and the current list and archived list of shows are loaded into `Model`.

*Step 2* +
The user executes `view-monthly June 2017` to check the revenue earned by all shows in June 2017. Once `Parser` verifies
that the command is of correct format, `ViewMonthlyCommand` calls `OptixDateFormatter#getMonth()` and
`OptixDateFormatter#getYear()` to get the integer values of month and year respectively.

*Step 3* +
`ViewMonthlyCommand` calls `Model#getShowsHistory()` since the date is in the past. This hashmap of `ShowsHistory` is
then passed into the `Model#findMonthly()` of the `Model` where a list of the shows in the specified month is created.

*Step 4* +
The profit for each of the shows in the remaining list is then added up in `Model` by calling `Theatre#getProfit()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view-monthly operation works:

image::images/devguide/DG_ViewMonthly_SequenceDiagram.png[width ="600", align="center"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the ViewMonthly Command:

image::images/devguide/DG_ViewMonthly_ActivityDiagram.png[width ="300", align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

*Aspect: How view-monthly executes*

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Saves the archive shows and current shows separately.
** Pros: Reduces search time Optix knows which list to search from.
** Cons: Archive list does not need any methods and certain parameters since it is only a list to store show names and
revenue. Have to insert dummy values for Archive list since Archive and current list are from the same class and now
use the same parameters.

* Alternative 2: Save archive and current shows together
** Pros: Archive list and current list will have their own class and reduces dependency.
** Cons: Certain code needs to be repeated which may be confusing.

=== [Proposed] Sell Seats Feature
Allows user to sell seats for a specific show.

==== Proposed Implementation
Selling of seats is executed by the `SellSeatCommand`, which extends from an abstract class `Command` and
is stored under the commands package. Additionally, it implements the following operations based on the user input.

* OptixDateFormatter#isValidDate -- Ensures that the date keyed is valid.
* Model#containsKey -- Check if the date has any show scheduled.
* Model#hasSameName -- Check if the show name matches the show in the TreeMap for the specified date.
* Model#sellSeat -- Sell seats corresponding to the seat number that is keyed by user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sell seat mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1* +
The user executes `sell Phantom of the Opera|5/5/2020|C1 D6 E10` command to sell the following seats C1 D6 E10
for the show Phantom of the Opera on 5th May 2020. The `SellSeatCommand` command calls `OptixDateFormatter#isValidDate(String date)`
to first check if the given date is a valid date.

*Step 2* +
Once verified, the `SellSeatCommand` command calls `Model#containsKey(LocalDate date)` and `Model#hasSameName(LocalDate date, String showName)`
to check if the show in query exist within `Model`.

*Step 3* +
Once it has been confirmed that the show exist, the `SellSeatCommand` command calls `Model#sellSeats(LocalDate date, String[] seats)`
to query if the seats have been booked. Whenever a seat has been purchased successfully, the revenue obtained from
the show will then be updated accordingly.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes sell seat command.

image::images/devguide/DG_SellSeat_ActivityDiagram.png[width ="300", align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

*Aspect: How sell seat executes* +

* Alternative 1 (current choice)
** Format: `sell Harry Potter | 5/5/2020 | A1 A2 A3 A4`

** Pros:
*** Easy to implement and less buggy.
*** Simplicity of code allows it to handle exception and edge cases more efficiently.
*** Ability to bulk purchase seats.

** Cons:
*** Less intuitive. User has to carry out one additional command view before carrying out the booking.

* Alternative 2 (previous choice):
** Format: `sell Harry Potter | 5/5/2020`
** Alternative: `sell Harry Potter | 5/5/2020 | A1 A2 A3 A4`

** Pros:
*** More flexible. Seating arrangement will be shown without explicit command for it.
*** Ability to bulk purchase seats.

** Cons:
*** Incompatible with GUI as code requires CLI query for seats, causing GUI to hang once command is used.
*** Code is deeply-nested which violates coding standards.
*** User has to key in the seats 1 by 1.

Below is the code snippet for our previous implementation:

image::images/devguide/DG_SellSeat_CodeBlock.png[align="center"]

*Choice for current implementation:* +

While *Alternative 2* is more intuitive and allows for better control over the sales of seats,
ultimately we have chosen *Alternative 1* as it is more compatible with our GUI codebase.
Furthermore with the implementation of GUI, it would also be more intuitive for the users
to get the seating arrangements for a particular show before they attempt to make any sales for the seat
as it would be impossible for them to memorise all the seats that they have sold.

=== Delete Show Feature
Allows users to delete shows from the shows ShowMap.

==== Implementation
It is executed by the `DeleteCommand`, which is extended from the abstract class `Command`, and is stored under the
Command package. Additionally, it implements the following operations based on the user input:

* DeleteCommand#hasValidDate -- checks if the input date is of a valid format
* Model#containsKey -- Checks for key in ShowMap.
* Model#hasSameName -- Checks for the existence of the show for the specified date in ShowMap.
* Model#deleteShow -- Removes the show from ShowMap.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sell seat mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1* +
The user inputs `delete Phantom of the Opera|5/5/2020|6/5/2020`, with the intention to delete shows dated on 5th May 2020
and 6th May 2020. The `DeleteCommand` is initialised with `Phantom of the Opera|5/5/2020|6/5/2020` as the `details`
attribute. The `details` string is parsed into the show name, and the individual dates.

image::images/devguide/DG_Delete_ObjectDiagram.png[width ="300", align="center"]

*Step 2* +
`DeleteCommand` iterates through the dates. It formats and verifies them through
`OptixDateFormatter#hasValidDate(String date)` to ensure the given dates are valid(that the date follows the format
DD/MM/YYYY). `LocalDate` instances are generated from these date strings.


*Step 3* +
`DeleteCommand` checks if the specified show exists on the verified dates using
`Model#containsKey(LocalDate showLocalDate)` and `Model#hasSameName(LocalDate showLocalDate, LocalDate showName)`. If it
exists, `Model#deleteShow(LocalDate showLocalDate)` is called to remove the show from the shows ShowMap. The details are
also appended to message to record the successful deletion. If it does not exist, then the date is added to
`missingShows`.

*Step 4* +
`DeleteCommand` checks if the specified show exists on the verified dates using
`Model#containsKey(LocalDate showLocalDate)` and `Model#hasSameName(LocalDate showLocalDate, LocalDate showName)`.

The activity diagram below illustrates the logic process of the `DeleteCommand`:

image::images/devguide/DG_Delete_ActivityDiagram.png[width ="300", align="center"]

The following code snippet highlights the key logic of the `DeleteCommand`.

image::images/devguide/DG_Delete_CodeBlock.png[align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

* Aspect: How delete works

* *Alternative 1*: Splitting the delete feature into `delete-one` and `delete-all`. I.e. Splitting the delete feature
into the 2 abilities: to delete 1 specific show, and to delete all shows of the specified show name. +
This design would use 2 separate commands, `DeleteOneCommand` and `DeleteAllCommand`. The user would use
`delete-one SHOW_NAME|SHOW_DATE`, and `delete SHOW_NAME` as the input format for the function to delete one
show, and to delete all the specified shows respectively.

** Pros: `delete-all` would enable the user to delete all the shows of specified show name with less hassle, without
having to input all the dates.
** Cons: Having 2 delete functions is less intuitive and may confuse new users, making them more prone to deleting
multiple shows unintentionally.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Implementation)*: One common delete feature that can delete multiple shows at once.

** Pros: This method is intuitive and flexible, as it enables users to delete multiple shows with a single command.
This makes deletions faster, and users will save time by typing less. This is important since this is a command-line
based application.
** Cons: If the user wishes to delete all shows of a specific name, the user has to input all of the dates which the
show is scheduled for. This can in turn slow down the user instead. However, the instances of this happening is less
likely.

=== Command Aliasing
Enabling users to set up aliases for the commands.

==== Implementation
Command aliasing is executed primarily by the `Parser`, which is stored under the `util` package. Some features related
to command aliasing such as adding, removing, or listing of aliases is executed via commands. The aliases for commands
are stored in the `commandAliasMap` within the Parser object. These pairs are also saved within a text file,
`ParserPreferences.txt`, so that the user can continue to use the aliases after the application is restarted. The
location of `ParserPreferences.txt` is decided in `Optix.java`. By default, it is located in `src/main/data`.

The following operations are operations related to command aliasing:

* Parser#addAlias(NEW_ALIAS, COMMAND) -- adds a alias-command pair to the commandAliasMap.
* Parser#removeAlias(NEW_ALIAS, COMMAND) -- removes a alias-command pair from the commandAliasMap.
* Parser#loadPreferences() -- loads all alias-command pairs from `ParserPreferences.txt`. `ParserPreferences.txt` is the
file where all the alias-command pairs are saved.
* Parser#resetPreferences() -- clears all alias-command pairs from `commandAliasMap` and adds in the default
alias-command pairs. This method does not access `ParserPreferences.txt`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of where command aliasing is used.

*Step 1* +
The user starts the application. A parser object will be initialised, and `loadPreferences()` will be called as part of
the initialisation process for it. If `ParserPreferences.txt` does not exist, it is created, and `resetPreferences()` is
called. `CommandAliasMap` is populated, and these pairs are also written to `ParserPreferences.txt`.

*Step 2* +
The user adds a new alias. An example input would be `add-alias q|add`. This command would associate the character
q with the command `add`. This calls the `AddAliasCommand`, which verifies that ‘q’ and “add” are valid aliases and
commands respectively (more on valid aliases and commands below). After the alias-command pair is verified, the pair
is put in the `commandAliasList`, and a success message is presented.

*Step 3* +
The user uses the alias by replacing “add” with “q” for any input. An example would be to use
`q The Lion King|20|31/12/2019` instead of `add The Lion King|20|31/12/2019`.

*Step 4* +
The user decides that setting this alias was a mistake, and decides to remove it with the input `remove-alias q|add`.
This calls the `RemoveAliasCommand()`. The command verifies that this pair exists, and can be removed. It then
removes this pair from the `commandAliasList`.

*Step 5* +
The user decides to list all aliases with the input `list-alias`. This calls the `ListAliasCommand`, which prints
all alias-command pairs in the `commandAliasList`.

*Step 6* +
The user decides that he has too many self-added aliases which he no longer wants. He uses the reset alias function
to reset his aliases to the default settings, with the input `reset-alias`. This calls the `ResetAliasCommand`, which
clears all existing aliases, and adds in the default aliases, which are defined in the `resetPreferences()` method in
the `Parser` class.
