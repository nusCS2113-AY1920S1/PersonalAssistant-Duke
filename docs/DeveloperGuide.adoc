== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the application. Given below is a quick overview of each component.


`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/com.algosenpai.app/Launcher.java[`Launcher`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/com.algosenpai.app/MainAp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initialising the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`Ui`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor and the question generator.
* <<Design-Model,*`Stats`*>>: Holds the relevant user statistics and settings in memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `help`.

.Component interactions for `help` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`DialogBox`, `DialogBoxUser`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `Logic`.
.  The command execution will result in the `Ui` to generate a `DialogBox` on the screen.
.  The quiz is generated by the `QuizGenerator` using the `Chapter` classes in the `chapters` package.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `executeCommand("help")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `help` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Parser Component

When the user inputs a command, the command will be parsed through by the parser class, checking for the validity of the command by comparing it with the enum of commands.

. If valid, the command will be split by the spaces in between them and stored into an arraylist. (e.g. `select 3` will be split into {select, 3})
    - The logic class will then call for the first string in the arraylist, in which it will be used to determine which command to call for next.
. If invalid, the InvalidCommand class will be called for, whereby the user will be notified to input a valid command: `error please input a valid command`.

image::ParserandCommandClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` class handles the reading and writing of user data to and from text files. It consists of two methods:

* `saveData`: Takes in a filename and a string, saves the string to the filename.
* `loadData`: Takes in a filename, returns the text in that file as a string.

A few implementation details to take note of:

. The `Storage` class only has static methods. This means that you do should not instantiate the object. The reasons
for doing this are:
- The class does not need to hold any state because of it's simple task,
so it does not make sense to instantiate an object.
- It is much more convenient to use, as you do not need to create a new `Storage` object for every storage operation.
. The methods handle strings, instead of the object that is being stored/retrieved.
This is so that methods can operate independently of what is being stored. The converting the object
to string and vice-versa has to be handled within that class. This pattern reduces coupling.
- The one situation which breaks this rule is when `loadData` is done on a file that doesn't exist yet.
In the current version, a default `UserStats` object is returned. Ideally this will be changed for the final version.

[[Design-UserData]]
=== Stats component

.Structure of the Stats Component
image::StatsClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The Stats component defines what data is stored permanently. It includes information about the user, and the
statistics for each chapter (such as correct answer %, number of attempts).

[discrete]
==== Relationship between Stats and `Storage`
The `Storage` component is used to store
this data permanently and retrieve it from storage later. An instance of `UserStats` is used to hold
and modify the data during runtime.

[discrete]
==== Description of the classes
* `ChapterStat` holds the statistics about the quiz attempts for that chapter, such as answer %, and number of attempts.
* `UserStats` holds an ArrayList of `ChapterStat` s, one for each chapter. It also holds some additional information
about the user, such as name, gender.

[discrete]
==== How to handle storage
Each class has a `toString` method that converts the data in that object to a string representation that can be
stored in the text file. If the name of your `UserStats` instance is `userStats`, pass
 `userStats.toString()` as the parameter to `Storage.saveData()`.

Similarly, each class has a static `parseString()` to convert a string to the object. Pass the result of
`Storage.loadData()` to `UserStats.parseString()` to get the `UserStats` object.

Note that `ChapterStat` has its own `parseString` and `toString` methods which are used by the corresponding `UserStats`
methods. This is done so increase modularity.

IMPORTANT: When editing the `toString` method, make sure to edit the corresponding `parseString` method (and vice-versa)

[discrete]
==== How to use `UserStats`
* Use the `currentChapter` object to hold stats for the current chapter while it is being played. Afterwards,
use `saveCurrentChapterToChapterData` to transfer the relevant data from `currentChapter` to the appropriate
element in the `chapterData` ArrayList.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::print[]
=== [Proposed] Printing Archived/Quiz/UserStats features
==== Proposed Implementation
This feature allows the user print the attempted quiz, the archived questions and his/her profile to PDF. The user has
to input `print archive` into the text field to print the archived questions, `print quiz` to print the quiz questions,
and `print report` to print the user profile. `PrintArchiveCommand` is used to print to archive questions to PDF, and
`PrintReportCommand` for the user stats, and `PrintQuizCommand` for the quiz. The `PrintArchiveCommand`,
`PrintQuizCommand`, and `PrintReportCommand` is a children class of `PrintCommand`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Modularizing program to write to PDF
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use inheritance.
** Pros: Allow future expansion for specific commands, share the inherited method `saveToPdf` from the `PrintCommand` to write the data into PDF.
** Cons: Increase storage size and memory usage from multiple files and instances.
* **Alternative 2:** Use overloading.
** Pros: Convenient to parse the data to write to PDF.
** Cons: Difficult to develop other features to print to PDF in future.

// tag::audio[]
=== [Proposed] Playing Audio features
==== Proposed Implementation
This feature allows the user play in-built music while he/she uses the application. The music will be randomly chosen
and played. Once the music ends, another music start playing. The user can input `sound <sound level>` to adjust the
sound level. For example, `sound 0` means the music is off, while `sound 10` means the music is played at maximum
intensity. This feature is separated into `MusicController` and instantiated in the `MainApp`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Tracking when to play the next music
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use multi-threading to playing the music.
** Pros: Reduce timing overhead due to asynchronous execution.
** Cons: Code is not able to reuse.
* **Alternative 2:** Use the `AnimationTimer` in `JavaFx` to poll and check the music status.
** Pros: Easy to implement and reuse `AnimationTimer`.
** Cons: Additional overhead for the `AnimationTimer` due to synchronous execution.

===== Aspect: Data structure to contain the music
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `HashMap` to store the list of music.
** Pros: Easy to store and track the music name in a `HashMap` using `SoundEnum`
** Cons: Need to convert to a list of string to display music name on the user interface.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `List` to store the music
** Pros: Easy to random a music, display music on the user interface, and search for the music name in a list.
** Cons: More prone to mistakes when handling the music names in `String`.
