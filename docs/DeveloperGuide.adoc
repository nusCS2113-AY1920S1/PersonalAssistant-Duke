== Introduction

*Dr. Duke* is a command-line based personal assistant for doctors to manage their patients' data.

It provides house officers with a streamlined notebook environment, which allows them to concentrate on the recording of
patient data with a pre-defined structure.

In order to be a successful *Dr. Duke* developer, you need a general understanding of: +

*  *Dr. Duke*’s architecture and object model
*  The Java framework on which *Dr. Duke* builds on

== Setting up
=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

== Use Cases

(For all use cases, the *System* is `Dr. Duke` and the *Actor* is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)


[appendix]
== Non Functional Requirements

.   The software should achieve 99% uptime.
.   The software should be portable, i.e. work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as the OS has Java `11` or
    above installed.
.   The software should be able to hold up to 500 patients without a noticeable reduction in performance for
    typical usage.
.   The software should work without internet access.
.   The software should have good user documentation, which details all aspects of the software to assist new
    users on how to use this software.
.   The software should have good developer documentation to allow developers to understand the design of the
    software easily so that they can further develop and enhance the software.
.   The software should be easily testable.
.   A user with an above average typing speed for regular English text should be able to accomplish most of his/her
    intended tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
