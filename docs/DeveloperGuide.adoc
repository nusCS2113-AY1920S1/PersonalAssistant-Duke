== Setting Up
=== Prerequisites
While Duke 2.0 may work using diffferent versions of Java and with other IDEs, the following are recommended because they have been used for testing:

* Java Development Kit '11'
* Intellij IDE

=== Setup on local Computer


*Manual Import:*

. `Fork` this Repository and `Clone` your remote repository locally to your computer
. Open *Intellij IDE* and set up JDK `11`
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` > `JDK` and select the path of the installed JDK `11`
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate project directory of the cloned repository
. Click `Next`
. Ensure that the `src folder` is checked ✅, and Click `Next` until the `Finish` button appears
. Click the `Finish` button


*Automatic Import using Intellij Check Out:*

. `Fork` this Repository
. Open *Intellij IDE* and set up JDK `11`
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` > `JDK` and select the path of the installed JDK `11`
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Check out from Version Control` > `Git`
. Enter URL of your remote repository > Click `Clone`
. Wait for Intellij to Set Up the project


=== Verifying Setup
. Ensure that Gradle has been imported by running `src/java/javafx/Launcher.java`
. Test out basic Duke 2.0 commands by referring to the User Guide
