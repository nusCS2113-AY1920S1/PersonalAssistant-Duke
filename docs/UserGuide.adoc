== Introduction

Our Javafx app is primarily targeted at people in Singapore who have huge love and interest for movies and TV shows. Our app hence aims to provide a fast and efficient way to find and/or do movies and TV shows related stuff such as getting ratings and reviews for a particular movie and/or TV shows and etc. 

Most importantly, the app is also intended for people who prefer desktop apps over other types of apps, have the ability to type fast and prefer typing over other means of input. As such, the app will have a GUI (Graphical User Interface) but most of the user interactions will happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). 

Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>>  to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` (revision `11` or later) installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Only Java 11+ is supported. +
This app may not work with older major Java releases such as Java 10, 9, 8 etc.
+
. Download the latest entertainmentpro.jar link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-4/main/releases[here].
. Place the file in the designated folder that you want to use as the home folder for EntertainmentPro.
. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
     e.g. typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:
* *`search movies /current`:* displays all the current movies that are showing on cinemas
* *`view cinema`*: displays the location of all cinemas in Singapore
* *`help me`*: displays all available root commands
. Refer to <<Features for Movies and TV shows>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features for Movies and TV shows

*Command Format*

* Every command used in EntertainmentPro strictly follows a default command structure: `<root command>` `<sub-root>` `<payload>` `<flags>`.

* The structure for `[flags]` can be `-<key>` `<flag title>` or simply `-<key>`.

* Both the root command and the sub-root are one worded each, while payload and flag title can multi-worded.

* Payload and flags may not needed depending on the particular command.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters (i.e. payload) to be supplied by the user e.g. in `search movies QUERY_KEYWORDS`, `QUERY_KEYWORDS` is a parameter which can be used as `search movies harry potter`.

* Items in square brackets are optional (i.e. flags) e.g. `QUERY_KEYWORD [-g/GENRE_NAME]` can be used as `harry potter -g fantasy` or as `harry potter`.

* Square brackets with `...` inside them can have multiple flag titles (but at least 1), with each flag title separated by a `,` e.g. `-g GENRE_NAME ...` can be used as `-g fantasy`, `-g fantasy, animation` etc.

* Some commands provide the option of multiple flagging at once but the each flags can still be used individually with the command.

=== Viewing help: `help`

Format: `help ROOT_COMMAND`

[TIP]
Keying in `help me` displays the list of all possible root commands
