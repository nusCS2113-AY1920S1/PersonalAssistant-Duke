== Introduction
<<<
=== The Product
DEGREES.NUS is a desktop application developed to help *prospective applicants of NUS Faculty of Engineering* view, choose  and manage engineering degrees, modules, and course events in a coherent and systematic manner.

DEGREES.NUS offers various functionalitites that range from comparing the details of two different engineering degrees, to adding and sorting these degrees into a personalised list and viewing past statistics of the degrees. Moroever, as a task manager, DEGREES.NUS is suitable to be used as a personal assistant as it lets you organise and remind you of the important tasks pertaining to university application, such as document submission deadlines or freshman events.

DEGREES.NUS specifically fits users who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of an appealing Graphical User Interface (GUI). Also, if you are particularly adept at typing fast, DEGREES.NUS will handle your commands more quickly than traditional GUI apps. 

=== The Document

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `delete INDEX`, `INDEX is a parameter which can be used as `delete 4`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `EVENT at/dd-MM-yyyy HHmm [to/dd-MM-yyyy HHmm]` can be used as `Mista at/04-04-2004 0444` or as `MISTA at/04-04-2004 0444 to/04-04-2004 0445`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[at/dd-MM-yyyy HHmm]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `at/04-04-2004 0444`, `at/04-04-2004 0444 at/08-08-2008 0808` etc.
* Items with `|` in between them indicate the user can choose to use either type of parameter e.g. `DEGREE|MODULE` will accept `CEG` or `CS1010`.

=== Viewing Helpful Commands : `help`
To view a full list of possible commands that DEGREES.NUS understands, you can call the help command.

Format: `help`

<<<
=== Viewing detailed information about a degree: `detail`

Lists all the information associated with a degree or module. +
Format: `detail DEGREE|MODULE`

[TIP]
The search is case insensitive. e.g `ceg` will match `CEG`

Example:

`detail CEG`

Returns: 
----
Overview:
...
Modules:
...
Links
...
----

Example:

`detail CS1010`

Returns: 
----
Overview:
...
Resources:
...

<<<
=== Comparing two degrees: `compare`

Lists the module similarities and differences between two degree programs given their keywords. +
Format: `compare DEGREE DEGREE`


****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `ceg` will match `CEG`
* If a degree is compared to itself, an invalid comparison message will be displayed e.g. `diff CEG CEG` will give the message `Invalid Comparison`
* There will be a list of similar modules displayed.
* This is followed by a list of modules which are different, shown in split view.
****

Example:

`compare CEG EE`

Returns:
----
Similarities:
EE2026
MA1511
...

Differences:
CS1010 
EE2027
...
----


<<<
=== Adding a degree into your degree list: `add`
To add a degree programme you are interested in into your personalised degree list, use the command add. +
Format: `add DEGREE`


****
* The search is case sensitive, e.g Computer engineering will throw an error. Ensure it is in the format as show in the examples.
****


Examples:

* `add Computer Engineering`
* `add Materials Science and Engineering`

=== Listing all degrees in your degree list : `choices`

Shows a list of all the degrees you are interested in currently. +
Format: `choices`

=== Swapping degree in your degree list: `swap`

Swaps the position of two degrees in the list  so that your degrees reflect the order in which you are interested in the degrees. +
Format `swap INDEX1 INDEX2`

****
* The indices must be positive integers
* The degree at INDEX1 will be replaced by the degree at INDEX2 and vice-versa
* The order of indicies doesn't matter i.e. `swap 1 5` will have the same functionality as `swap 5 1`
****

Examples:

* `swap 1 2` +
Replaces the degree at index 1 with the degree that is already existing in index 2 and the degree at index 2 is now the degree at index 1

<<<
=== Removing a degree in your degree list : `remove`

Removes a degree you are not interested in anymore from your degree list. +
Format: `remove INDEX`

****
* Removes the degree at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
