== Introduction

**ModPlan**

Your one stop solution to module planning through out your university tenure! +
ModPlan is a module planning system that expands on NUSMODS to help NUS Computer Engineering students to plan their modules for all four years of their bachelor's degree. ModPlan also helps NUS Computer Engineering students to customise the modules they want to take and keep track of the current and future modules to be taken. As such, NUS Computer Engineering students can graduate in time with the planning provided by the ModPlan!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ModPlan.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ModPlan application.
//.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`show module`* : shows all modules
* **`add`**`module CG2028` : searches for a module with a module code of CG2028 and adds the module into the module list
* **`remove`**`module 3` : deletes the 3rd module shown in the module list
* *`bye`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you e.g. in `add module MOD_CODE`, `MOD_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add module CG1112` or `add module GES1012`.
//* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
//* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

=== Calculating the CAP : `cap`

Calculates your overall CAP or predicted CAP in different ways.

==== Calculating CAP from user input. +
Format: `cap overall`

****
* Typing `cap overall` into the command line shows a CAP calculation message.
* Type the module taken, along with it's letter grade. +
Keep typing all the module names in the module list and their respective grades with the format shown below.
* Format: `MOD_CODE GRADE_LETTER`
* Type `done` when you are ready to calculate the CAP.
* ModPlan then shows your current cumulative or predicated CAP.
****

Example: +
`cap overall` + 
`CG2028 A` +
`CS2027 B-` + 
`done`

==== Calculating CAP from the module list. +
Format: `cap list`

****
* Type `cap list` into the command line.
* ModPlan will show you your list of modules and grades to calculate CAP from.
* ModPlan will then calculate your CAP based on the completed modules in your module list.
** Note that S/U'ed modules or modules without a grade will not be used in the calculation.
****

Example: +
`cap list`

==== Calculating predicted CAP of a module from it's prerequesites. +
Format: `cap module`

****
* Type `cap module` into the command line.
* ModPlan will then prompt you for the module to calculate CAP for.
* Type the module code of the module you wish to predict your CAP for.
* ModPlan will automatically sort the prerequisites of that module and check for your grades in them.
** Note that these prerequisites have to be added and graded in your module list.
** If any prerequisites are not completed, ModPlan will print a list of the prerequisites you have yet to complete/give a grade for.
****

Example: +
`cap module` +
`CS2040C`

=== Grading your modules: `grade`

Allows you to input your letter grade received for the modules you have taken. +
Format: `grade MOD_CODE LETTER_GRADE`

* Type `grade MOD_CODE LETTER_GRADE` into the command line, replacing `MOD_CODE` with an actual module code, and `LETTER_GRADE` with the grade you received for that module.
* ModPlan will either update the grade of the module if it is in your list, or add the module with the letter grade included if it is not in your list.
* ModPlan will also check if the module is S/U-able, and will allow the user to input S and U grades accordingly.
** If the module is not S/U-able, ModPlan will inform the user if they try to input a S or U grade.
****

Example: +
`grade CS1010 A-` +
`grade CS1231 S`

[[Errors]]
== Errors
*Error Handling*
* When you input commands or parameters in a way that the program does not understand, errors will be thrown, which let you know what is wrong.

[TIP]
If you follow what the errors tell you to fix in your command, you can get the program to work as intended!

=== `ModBadRequestStatus`
This error appears when there is bad internet connection. The information from the nusMods V2 API is not fully fetched.

Example of error message: `Error: Bad Status Connection!`

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> Reconnect to a stronger and more stable wifi connection.

=== `ModFailedJsonException`
This error appears when the file from the nusMods V2 API is not correctly converted for Java usage.

Example of error message: `Error: Failed to parse data file!`

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> Reconnect to a stronger and more stable wifi connection.

=== `ModNotFoundException`
This error appears when you search for a module code that is not found in the nusMod list.
