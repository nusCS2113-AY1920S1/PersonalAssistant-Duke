== Introduction

**ModPlan**

Your one stop solution to module planning through out your university tenure!

ModPlan is a module planning system that expands on NUSMODS to help NUS Computer Engineering students to plan their modules for all four years of their bachelor's degree.

ModPlan also helps NUS Computer Engineering students to customise the modules they want to take and keep track of the current and future modules to be taken.

As such, NUS Computer Engineering students can graduate in time with the planning provided by the ModPlan!

Developed and maintained by the link:{repoURL}//tree/master/docs/AboutUs.adoc[AY1920S1-CS2113T-F10-1 team].

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html[`11`] or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `[CS2113T-F10-1][ModPlan].jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ModPlan application.
.  Open any terminal application, for example `Command Prompt` on Windows or `Terminal` on Mac in the folder directory containing ModPlan.
.  Run the following `java -jar ModPlan-v1.4.0.jar` in the terminal application.
.  A welcome message should be prompted in the terminal.
.  Type the commands in the terminal and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`show module`* : shows all modules
* **`add`**`module CG2028` : searches for a module with module code of CG2028 and adds the module into the module list
* **`remove`**`module 3` : deletes the 3rd module shown in the module list, if there are at least 3 modules in the list
* *`bye`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you e.g. in `add module MOD_CODE`, `MOD_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add module CG1112` or `add module GES1012`.
* Arguments for time `--begin` and `--end` are supposed to be given in 24 hour format. Due to the use of `Natty` library for relative date parsing, other formats would work but may result in
 anomalous behavior. The list of known expected behavior can be found under <<Expected Anomalous Behavior>>.

[[Errors]]
== Errors
*Error Handling*
When you input commands or parameters in a way in which the program does not understand, errors will be thrown, informing the user what was causing the error.

[TIP]
If you follow what the errors tell you to fix in your command, you can get the program to work as intended!
 +
 +
Or even better, simply type or add `-h` to the end of the command you intend to input and ModPlanner will output a detailed guildline for you!

// tag::ParserErrors[]

=== Parser Errors
If you encountered an error message starting with `ModPlanner: error:`, then this section is for you!

There are 4 common types of Parser Errors:

==== `ModPlanner: error: invalid choice ...`
This error appears when you input an invalid command or argument to ModPlanner. However, the error message will display the valid options for you. In some cases, ModPlanner may even suggest a possible command that it thinks you intended to write!
 +
 +
Example of input that can cause this error: `clean` +
Example error message:

image::ParserInvalidChoice.png[]

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> Select one from the provided legal options. ModPlanner even noticed that you probably meant `clear` which is a valid command, and suggested it.
 +

==== `ModPlanner: error: too few arguments`
This error appears when you do not supply enough arguments for a specific command.
 +
 +
Example of input that can cause this error: `add module` +
Example error message:

image::ParserTooFewArguments.png[]

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> Look for the missing arguments as provided in the error message. In this case, it is `moduleCode`. If you are unsure what to input for `moduleCode`, try `add module -h`.

image::ParserAddModuleHelp.png[]

==== `ModPlanner: error: unrecognized arguments: ...`
This error appears when the name of a named argument is specified incorrectly.
 +
 +
Example of input that can cause this error: `add cca test cca --beginTime 15:00 --end 5pm --dayOfWeek MONDAY` +
Example error message:

image::ParserUnrecognizedArguments.png[]

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> Look for the correct argument name as provided in the error message! In this case, `--beginTime` should be changed to `--begin`.
 +

==== `ModPlanner: error: argument index: could not convert ...`
Certain arguments should be parsed in the correct format in order for the value to be evaluated correctly. If you encounter this error, chances are you tried to parse a non-integer value to an integer-type argument.
 +
 +
Example of input that can cause this error: `remove cca notANumber` +
Example error message:

image::ParserCouldNotConvert.png[]

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> Look for the correct type of the argument from the error message and change your argument to match the type. In this case, `index` should be an `int` but the ModPlanner could not convert the input value `notANumber` to an `int`. An example of a correct command is `remove cca 1` (provided your CCA list is not empty!).

// end::ParserErrors[]

=== `ModBadRequestStatus`
This error appears when there is poor or unstable Internet connection. The information from the nusMods V2 API is not fully fetched.

Example of error message: `Error: Bad Status Connection!`

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> Reconnect to a stronger and more stable wifi connection.

=== `ModFailedJsonException`
This error appears when the file from the nusMods V2 API is not correctly converted for Java usage.

Example of error message: `Error: Failed to parse data file!`

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> Reconnect to a stronger and more stable wifi connection.

=== `ModNotFoundException`
This error appears when you search for a module code that is not found in the nusMod list.

image::ModNotFoundException.png[width="250"] 

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> ****
> * Input another module code which exists in the nusMod list. +
> * Input the correct module code into the command line. +
> ****

=== `ModCommandException`
This error appears when you do not input a valid command name into the command line.

image::ModCommandException.png[width="250"] 

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> ****
> * Input a valid command name into the command line. +
> * If unsure of the available command names, refer to the <<Command Summary>>. + 
> ****

=== `ModCcaScheduleException`
This error appears when you input a CCA whose time period clashes with another CCA.

Example of error message: `Error: This CCA clashes with existing CCA!`

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> Input another CCA with a timing that does not clashes with the exisiting CCAs.

=== `ModBadGradeException`
This error appears when you input an invalid letter grade.

Example of input that can cause this error: `grade CS1010 O` +
Example of error message: 

image::ModBadGradeException.png[width="350"] 

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> Input one of the following grades: "A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, D+, D, F, S or U".

=== `ModBadSuException`
This errors appears when you input an S or U grade for a module that does not have an S/U option.

Example of input that can cause this error: `grade CG2028 S` +
Example of error message: 

image::ModBadSuException.png[width="450"] 

> **_Solving the error:_** +
> ****
> * Use `show module` to check whether the module is S/U'able.
> * Only modules with the "SU: true" indicates that the module is S/U'able and an S or U grade can be input.
> ****

== Coming in ModPlan v2.0

=== Password management

==== Add or update an existing password: `passwd`
Add or update an existing password. +
If a password has been previously set (updating password mode), a prompt will show up asking for old password before a new one can setup. In that case, kindly enter your current password as prompted to setup a new one. +
Format: +
`passwd myPassword`

=== GUI
ModPlan v2.0 will support GUI (Graphical User Interface). We have not decided whether the CLI (Command Line Interface) will be fully replaced by GUI or will be an additional feature. However, the new GUI will hopefully improve ModPlan's user-friendliness and user's productivity.

== Expected Anomalous Behavior

****
* Writing shortform commands for some of the commands may work, due to the program identifying the shortform as a unique input for the command.
** Example `sh module` will return the same output as `show module` as `sh module` is unique enough for the program to identify its intended command.
* Inputting an invalid time beyond `00:00` such as `25:00` will cause the time to automatically be set to `00:00`
* Some of the prerequisites/preclusions in NUSMODS may not be updated for the `cap module`, or is not checked against each other in the prerequisite tree.
** If you have completed all the necessary prerequisites but it is still showing you have not completed some of them, please add those modules into your list with the same grade you obtained as its preclusion and try the command again.
****
