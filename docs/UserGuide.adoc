== 1. Introduction

Optix is a desktop application made for users who want to manage the seating of a theatre or other venues while keeping track of the finances earned. Optix is optimised for users who can type fast and prefers using a Command Line Interface (CLI) to other methods. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is also developed for additional user interaction. Want to skip the process of going through multiple steps to manage bookings and viewing your profits? If you can type fast and want to avoid this hassle, Optix is the perfect application for you! Jump to Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started.
