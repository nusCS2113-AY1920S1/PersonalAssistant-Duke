== Introduction

RIMS (Resource and Inventory Management System) is a *command-line* logistic management system designed to manage an organisation’s facilities and inventory. It takes in user commands to *track the booking and loaning out of an organisation’s resources*. It is designed for logistics managers and executives aspiring to streamline and digitise the accounting  of their inventory. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest RIMS JAR file release https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W12-1/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your local version of RIMS.
.  In your terminal, navigate to this folder and run the command `java -jar {FILENAME.jar}`, where `{FILENAME.jar}` should be replaced with the name of the latest RIMS file.
.  The user interface should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`list`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will show you a list of all the rooms and items with their status (booked/reserved/available).
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all items/rooms and their status (booked/reserved/available)
* **`add`**`/item football /qty 2` : adds 2 footballs to RIMS.
* *`bye`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features, Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* The first word of each input string is the *command* requested by the user, to be executed by the program.
+
e.g. the word `*return*` in `*return* /id 1`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the *arguments* to be supplied by the user.
+
e.g. in `add /room *ROOM_NAME*`, `*ROOM_NAME*` is a parameter which can be used, as in `add /room *seminar room 1*`.
* Arguments always follow a *parameter*, which is denoted by a phrase starting with a forward slash `/`.
+
e.g. in `delete */item* _ITEM_NAME_`, `*/item*` denotes that `_ITEM_NAME_` is a parameter denoting the item to be deleted, as in `delete */item* shuttlecock`.
* Different commands features different parameters.
* Parameters must be in the order specified.
+
e.g. if the command specifies `add */item ITEM* _/qty QUANTITY_`, `add _/qty QUANTITY_ */item ITEM*` is not acceptable.
* Parameters and arguments in the input string must be separated from each other by only a single whitespace character.
+
i.e. tabs and non-spacebar whitespace are not allowed in the input string.

====
====
*Glossary*

* Item: an object in the user’s inventory. There can be multiple copies of an item in a user’s inventory (e.g. 5 pens)
* Room: a facility in the user’s inventory, of which there can only be one (e.g. seminar room 1)
* Resource: any item or room in the user’s inventory.
* User: the logistics administrator who is running the RIMS program.
* Requester: the person requesting to borrow a resource from the user’s inventory.

====

=== Adding and Removing Resources

==== Add resource: `add`
Adds a new resource to the user's inventory, which is available for loan/reservation in RIMS.

.*Format*:
* `add /item ITEM_NAME /qty QUANTITY`
* `add /room ROOM_NAME`
... `QUANTITY` specified must be a positive integer.
... If an item to be added already exists in RIMS, then its quantity will be incremented by the specified quantity.
... If a room to be added already exists in RIMS, the program will send an error message to the UI for the user's reading.
... For storage maintenance purposes, resources to be added should *not* have a comma character `,` in its name.

.*Examples*:
* `add /item book /qty 5`
* `add /room seminar room 1`

==== Delete resources: `delete`
Deletes a resource from the user's inventory in RIMS.

.*Format*:
* `delete /item ITEM_NAME`
* `delete /room ROOM_NAME`
====
.For item deletion:
* RIMS will display a list of all instances of the requested resource, and prompt the user to input the IDs of the resources to be deleted:
+
image:delete.png[]
+
* The ID must be inputted as a non-negative integer.
* If multiple resources are to be simultaneously deleted, the multiple resource IDs must be separated from each other by a single whitespace character.
* If the ID(s) inputted by the user are invalid, the program will send an error message to the UI.
====
... If the item or room does not exist in RIMS, then the UI will send a message to inform the user.

.*Examples*:
* `delete /item book` -> `6 7 8`
* `delete /room multi purpose sports hall`

=== Booking and returning resources

==== Loan out resources: `loan`
Registers a resource as having been loaned out, from the current date until a user-specified future date. The resource is thus unavailable for further loaning until it is returned.

.*Format*:
* `loan /item ITEM_NAME /qty QUANTITY /id USER_ID /by DEADLINE`
* `loan /room ROOM_NAME /id USER_ID /by DEADLINE`
... If the item or room does not exist in the RIMS inventory, the program will send an error message to the UI.
... `QUANTITY` must be a positive integer above 0.
... `USER_ID` must be a non-negative integer, with a value of 0 and above.
... If either of these values specified are invalid, the program will send an error message to the UI.
... If the user requests a quantity that is greater than the existing amount of that item in the inventory, the UI will send an error message to the user.
... Rooms are unique and thus do not require quantities.
... The deadline must be a valid date in the format `DD/MM/YYYY HHmm`, or in the example format `Tuesday HHmm`, for which the resource will be booked from the current date until the next Tuesday at the specified time.
... If the deadline specified is in an invalid format, the program will send an error message.

.*Examples*:
* `loan /item book /qty 5 /id 1 /by 23/11/2019 1500`
* `loan /room mpsh /id 2 /by Wednesday 1700`

==== Reserve resources: `reserve`
Registers a resource as having been reserved for use between two dates in the future. The resource is thus unable to be further loaned or reserved during that time period.

While loans take effect from the current date to a specified deadline, reservations specify a future time-frame between which a resource is to be loaned out.

.*Format*:
* `reserve /item ITEM /qty QUANTITY /id USER_ID /from BORROW_DATE /by DEADLINE`
* `reserve /room ROOM /id USER_ID /from BORROW_DATE /by DEADLINE`
... For logistical purposes, only a resource that is currently in the user's inventory (i.e. is not currently out on loan) can be reserved.
... If the item or room does not exist in the RIMS inventory, the program will send an error message to the UI.
... `QUANTITY` must be a positive integer above 0.
... `USER_ID` must be a non-negative integer, with a value of 0 and above.
... If either of these values specified are invalid, the program will send an error message to the UI.
... If the user requests a quantity that is greater than the existing amount of that item in the inventory, the UI will send an error message to the user.
... Rooms are unique and thus do not require quantities.
... The date of borrowing, `BORROW_DATE`, and the deadline date, `DEADLINE`, must be a valid date, either in the format `DD/MM/YYYY HHmm`, or in the example format `Tuesday HHmm`, where `Tuesday` can be replaced by any day of the user's choice and will obtain the next available instance of that day and time.
... If the deadline specified is in an invalid format, the program will send an error message.

.*Examples*:
* `reserve /item basketball /qty 1 /from 01/12/2019 2300 /to 03/12/2019 2300`
* `reserve /room basketball court /from Monday 1600 /to 20/11/2019 2300`


==== Return resources: `return`
Registers a resource that has been loaned or reserved as returned to the user's inventory, and is thus available to be loaned out or reserved again.

.*Format*:
* `return /id USER_ID`
====
* RIMS will display a list of all reservations made by the requester whose ID was specified in the previous input, and prompt the user to input the reservation IDs of the reservations to be marked as returned:
+
image:return.png[]
+
* Each reservation ID is denoted by square brackets `[]`.
* The reservation IDs inputted must be non-negative integers.
* If multiple resources are to be simultaneously deleted, the multiple reservation IDs must be separated from each other by a single whitespace character.
* If the ID(s) inputted by the user are invalid or are not amongst the reservation IDs displayed, the program will send an error message to the UI.
====
... The `return` command takes the resource borrower's individual ID as an argument.
... The user ID `USER_ID` must be a non-negative integer.
... If the user whose ID was inputted has not made any reservations or loans, the program will print an error message to the UI.


.*Examples*:
* `return /item frisbee` -> `2`
* `return /room seminar room 1`


=== Retrieving resource information

==== List resources and their statuses: `list`
View all resources in the user's inventory, with a brief summary of currently available and booked resources. There is also an option to view a more detailed list of individual items and rooms, and to view the list of items available on a certain date.

.*Format*:
* `list`
... Generates a list of all resources, divided by resources which are currently available and resources which are currently booked.
* `list /item ITEM_NAME`
... Generates a list detailing the reservation status (booked or available) and the current reservations of all instances of the requested resource.
... If the item does not exist in the RIMS inventory, the program will send an error message to the UI.
* `list /room ROOM_NAME`
... Prints out the reservation status (booked or available) of the requested room, and if booked, prints out the details of the room's current reservation.
... If the item does not exist in the RIMS inventory, the program will send an error message to the UI.
* `list /date DATE`
... Generates a list of all available and booked resources on any specified date and time.
... The requested date `DATE` must be a valid date, either in the format `DD/MM/YYYY HHmm`, or in the example format `Tuesday HHmm`, where `Tuesday` refers to the next instance of Tuesday from the current date.
* `list /tag TAG`
... Generates a list of resources by tag name.
... The requested tag `TAG` must be valid.

==== View deadline of item/room: `deadlines`
Generates a list of all active loans and reservations, along with their deadlines, for the user's reading.

.*Format*:
* `deadlines`

==== Tag: `tag`
Tag the various resources in the inventory based on their function.

.*Format*:

. `tag /item ITEM /tag TAG`
. `tag /room ROOM /tag TAG`

.*Examples*:
* `tag /item pen /tag study`

==== View calendar: `calendar`
Generates a variable-size calendar which shows a monthly view of all the loaned and reserved resources in the current month.

.*Format*:
* `calendar`
... Generates a calendar, with a view of all the loaned and reserved resources in the current month.
* `calendar+`
... Increases the cell size of the calendar, allowing it to display more information.
* `calendar-`

... The calendar has a minimum cell size, beyond which it cannot be decreased.

==== View stats: `stats`
View how many resources are in used between two dates with interval less than 15 in the form of a simple bar graph.

.*Format*:
. `stats /from DATE /till DATE`

.*Example*:
. `stats /from 20/11/2019 1000 /till 29/11/2019 1000`

==== Undo last command: `undo`
Undoes the last command that made changes to RIMS.

.*Format*:
* `undo`

==== View resource statistics: `stats`
View statistics on the loan and reservation frequencies of resources between a user-specified time period.

The command generates a bar graph of resource reservations and loans per day, for the specified time period.

.*Format*:
* `stats /from FROM_DATE /till TILL_DATE`
... The parameters `FROM_DATE` and `TILL_DATE` must both be valid dates, specified either in the format `DD/MM/YYYY HHmm`, or in the example format `Tuesday HHmm`, where `Tuesday` can be replaced by any day of the user's choice and will obtain the next available instance of that day and time.
... If the dates specified are in an invalid format, the program will send an error message.

==== Exiting the program: `bye`
Terminates RIMS, saving all changes to the RIMS inventory (adding and deleting of resources, creation and deletion of loans and reservations) to the data files in the proces..
