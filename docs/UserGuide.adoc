**  For example, the command `add n/ MEAL` can be entered as the following:
.. `add n/ burger`
.. `add n/ fries`
.. `add n/ burger and fries`
** But not:
.. `add n/{nbsp}` (The user defined field is empty)
* Fields in square brackets `[]` are optional, and can be omitted from the input statement if unnecessary
** For example, `n/ MEAL [t/ TAG]` can be entered as:
.. `n/ burger t/ calories`
.. `n/ fries t/ sodium`
.. `n/ burger`
* Fields in arrow brackets `<>` are required after its preceding  optional tag
** For example, `[t/ TAG]` `<QUANTITY>` can be entered as:
.. `t/ calories` `100`
.. `t/ sodium` `10`
.. `{nbsp}` (The optional tag is not present)
** But not:
.. `t/calories` `{nbsp}` (The required user defined field is empty)
* Fields with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times
 ** For example, `[t/ TAG]...` can be entered as:
 .. `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times)
 .. `t/ calories`
 .. `t/ calcium t/ sodium`,  etc.
====
