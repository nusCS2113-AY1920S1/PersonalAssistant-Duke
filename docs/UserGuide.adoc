== Introduction

*Dr. Duke* is a command line-based personal assistant for doctors to manage their patients' data.

It provides house officers with a streamlined notebook environment, which allows them to concentrate on quickly and accurately recording patient data in a standard format.
If you're a house officer who types fast and don't mind learning how to use a keyboard-based application to type faster, then this application is for you!

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

* *JDK 11* or above (get the latest version of Java https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here])

=== Getting Started

. Download the latest `.jar` release file from our https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-1/main/releases[release page].
. Move the `.jar` file to the folder which you want to use as *Dr. Duke*'s home.
. Double click on the `.jar` file.

*Dr. Duke* should open shortly.

== Usage

* This app manages multiple Patients.
Each Patient has one or more Impressions (diagnoses), and each Impression is supported by Evidence and treated by Treatments.
** Evidences consist of Observations and Results [[evidences]]
** Treatments consist of Plans, Investigations and Medicine. [[treatments]]
* The different screens you can view are referred to as contexts. [[contexts]]
Each context is associated with a particular set of data to display, and has its own set of commands.
* `priority` refers to how critical a Treatment or Evidence is. 0 means not urgent, excluding the item from the criticality system, 1 means critical.
The other values are not defined specifically but the greater they are, the lower the priority.
These lower priority levels are meant to remain flexible for the user to provide his desired level of fine-graining and task management.
** `priority` 1 generally refers to something that needs to be followed up on or investigated immediately, e.g. signs of severe complications. `priority` 1 items will be displayed prominently to remind the house officer to respond to it when treating the patient. [[priority-1]]
* `status` refers to the stage of completion of a Treatment. `<status name>` refers to the textual description for each stage of completion.

= Specifying Commands

Commands consist of a command name, an argument, and some number of switches: settings for a command that modify its behavior.
Switches can also have arguments.

For example, `discharge "John Doe" -sum "John Doe was discharged on 9 October 2019 at 3:54 pm".` represents the command `discharge` with the argument `"John Doe"`, modified by the switch `-sum` (meaning "summary"), which has the switch argument `"John Doe was discharged on 9 October 2019 at 3:54 pm."`.

Only a few characters have a special meaning when you are giving Dr. Duke commands.
These are `\`, `-`, `<Space>`/`<Newline>`, and `<Enter>`:

* `\` -> Escape character: the special character after a backslash loses its special meaning.
To type a literal backslash, you need to escape the backslash: `Hello\\World` becomes `Hello\World`.
* `-` -> Indicates the start of a switch.
Must immediately be followed by an argument, if the switch requries one.
* `<Space>`/`<Newline>` -> A switch is separated from its argument by a space or a newline.
* `<Enter>` -> This sends a command to Dr. Duke. `<Shift-Enter>` would insert a new line.

The documentation below uses the following notation to describe the structure of the commands recognised:

* `<>` -> input of the type specified
* `[]` -> optional element of a command
* `(a | b | c)` -> input that can be one of several possible options, in this case `a`, `b` or `c`
* `"<>"` -> string, must be surrounded by quotes if it contains a space (or escape the space with a backslash)
* `[]*` -> 0 or more copies of the contents of `[]`, separated by spaces

The following italicised words refer to specific repeated patterns:

* _patient_id_ -> `(<patient's index in list> | "<search string>" | *-b[ed]* "<bed number>"")` [[patient_id]]
* _string_or_idx_ -> `(<index> | "<search string>")` [[string_or_idx]]
** `<index>` refers to the index assigned to the object in the display. `<search string>` will be searched for in the names of all relevant objects.
* _type_ -> (`*-m[edicine]*` | `*-in[v(x | estigation)]*` | `*-p[lan]*` | `*-o[bservation]*` | `*-r[esult]*`) [[type]]

Parsing rules:

* If a `"<search string>"` is given, the user will be presented with a page of search results that have names matching the search string, if the object to which it is referring is ambiguous. Refer to <<home-open, the `open` command in the Home context>> for a concrete example.
* Switches can be in any order.
* Switches with optional parts of their names can be recognised with any portion of the optional part. E.g. `-crit` matches `-c[ritical]`.
* If it is ambiguous whether an argument is for the command itself, or one of the switches, it will be presumed to belong to the switch.

== Contexts

The subsections below describe the available commands in each context.

=== Home [[home]]

Displays up to *100* indexed panels of `Patients`.
Each panel provides the user with a summary of the main details of a particular `Patient`.
They are as follows.

. Name
. Bed number
. Primary diagnosis
. <<Priority-1, Number of critical issues>>

==== `new` - Add a new Patient [[home-new]]

Format: `new *-n[ame]* "<name>" *-b[ed]* <bed number> *-a[llerg(y | ies)]* "<allergies>" *[<optional switch>]**` +

Optional switches*:

* `*-g[o]*`
* `*-h[eight]* <height>` (expressed in cm)
* `*-w[eight]* <weight>` (expressed in kg)
* `*-ag[e]* <age>`
* `*-num[ber]* <number>`
* `*-ad[dress]* "<address>"`
* `*-hi[story]* "<history>"`

The patient's name, bed number and allergies must be specified. Allergies should be expressed in comma-separated values (CSV).
The other optional fields are set to undefined values by default.
The `*-g[o]*` switch opens the <<Patient, Patient>>'s context for the newly added patient.

**Example:**
****
new John Doe *-b* A103 *-a* paracetamol *-h* 175 *-w* 60 *-ag* 35 *-hi* Heart disease
****

==== `open` - Go to a more detailed view of a particular Patient [[home-open]]

Format: `open <<patient_id, _patient_id_>> *[-im[pression]]*`

If opening by search string, patients will be searched through by name, and results presented and selected as per the <<home-find, `find`>> command. For example, if I have two patients named "John" and "Joe", `open jo` will open a search result context with the two patients.

If the optional `*-im[pression]*` switch is provided, access the <<impression, primary diagnosis>> for that particular Patient.

**Example**
****
`open 1 *-impress*` (open by index and go to primary impression) +
`open *-b* "C210"` (open by bed number) +
`open Duke` (open by search string)
****

==== `find` [[home-find]]

Format: `find ["<search string>"] [_type_]`

Display a list of all Impressions, Treatments and Evidence matching the criteria specified in the search.
If none of the <<type, `_type_`>> switches are used, all types of objects will be listed.
If at least one of them is listed, only objects whose type is used as a switch will be listed.

**Example**
****
find aspirin *-p*
****

==== `discharge` - Generate a discharge report for the patient and delete him/her from the system [[home-discharge]]

Format: `discharge <<patient_id, _patient_id_>> [*-sum[mary]]* "<discharge summary>"]`

The discharge report contains all of the information being tracked regarding the Patient.
An optional discharge summary may be specified in the command to add additional information.
In *v2.0*, they will be <<home-archive, archived>>.

**Example**
****
`discharge 5 *-summary* "Patient will return again at 02/11/2019 for final consultation"`
****

==== `undo` - Undo the previous command [*v2.0*] [[home-undo]]

Format: `undo <number of commands>`

_Available in:_ <<Home>>, <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

You may undo up to the last 10 commands.
Only commands that affect the state of the system count against this limit (e.g. adding new Patients or editing data, not navigating across contexts).

==== `redo` - Redo a command that has been undone [*v2.0*] [[home-redo]]

Format: `redo <number of commands>`

_Available in:_ <<Home>>, <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

After an <<home-undo, undo>> command is executed, any commands (other than `undo` or `redo`) sent will clear the `redo` stack.
The undone commands cannot be redone from that point onwards.

==== `critical` - Display all critical observations and plans of all patients [*v2.0*]

Format: `critical`

==== `archive` - Display all discharged patients [[home-archive]] [*v2.0*]

* List of allergies
* Medical history
* List of `Impressions` with their associated details (the name, an excerpt of its description,
and the number of critical items and follow-up investigations associated with it)
* List of critical <<treatments, Treatments>> and <<evidences, Evidences>> (of <<priority-1, priority 1>>)
* List of `Investigations` to follow up on (i.e. all current investigations; completed investigations should be stored as `Results`)

Inherits: <<home-help,`help`>>, <<home-undo,`undo`>>, <<home-redo,`redo`>>

==== `new` - Add a new Impression for this Patient

Format: `new *-n[ame]* "<name>" *-desc[ription]* "<description>" *[-g[o]]*` +

Opens the new <<impression, Impression>>'s context if `-g[o]` is specified.

**Example**
****
`new "Dengue Fever" *-desc* "High fever and back pain" *-g*`
****

==== `open` - Open a critical (<<treatments, `Treatment`>> / <<evidences, `Evidence`>>) or `Investigation` item listed on the page, or an `Impression`

If a _<search string>_ is used, the first result that matches the search string will be immediately accessed.

**Example**
****
`open 3 *-im*` +
`open "Fever"`
****

==== `edit` - Edit one of the details of the Patient [[patient-edit]]

|===

`<status name>` is a case-insensitive substring of the `statusArr` entry of that particular object, while `<status idx>` is its numerical representation.

==== `open` - Open a Treatment or Evidence item listed on this page

Format: `open ("<search string>" | *-e[vidence]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> | *-t[reatment]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>>)`

This will open a new context for the specific Treatment or Evidence identified.

==== `edit` - Edit one of the details of the Impression, or one of its Treatment or Evidence items

Format: `edit *[-app[end]]* ("<search string>" | *-e[vidence]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> | *-t[reatment]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> | *-im[pression]* ) <switch> [<new value>] [<switch> [<new value>]]`

If input with the `-im[pression]` switch set, it edits the `Impression` itself. The switches and corresponding new value formats are as follows:

* `*-n[ame]* "<name>"`
* `*-desc[ription]* "<description>"`

Otherwise, it edits the treatment or evidence specified.
The possible values for `<switch>` and `<new value>` can be found in the associated <<type-table,table>> for `new`.

==== `delete` - Delete a Treatment or Evidence item listed on this page

Format: `delete ("<search string>" | *-e[vidence]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>>  | *-t[reatment]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> )`

If a Treatment or Evidence is assigned incorrectly, it can be moved to a different Impression via this command.
If the `-im[pression]` switch is not used to specify the Impression to move it to, a window listing all Impressions will appear, and the user can select the correct Impression using its list index [*v1.4*].

==== `priority` - Mark a Treatment or Evidence as a certain priority level

Format: `priority ("<search string>" | *-e[vidence]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> | *-t[reatment]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>>) *-s* <new priority>`

`<new priority>` must be a non-negative integer.

==== `status` - Update the completion status of a Treatment

Format: `status <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> [*-s* ("<status name>" | <status idx>)]`

If `-s` is not specified, `status` will be incremented by 1, unless it is at the maximum value.

==== `result` - Convert an Investigation that has been completed into a Result

Format: `result <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> *-sum[mary]* "<result summary>"`

_idx_ in this scope will refer to an index in the Treatment list.
The result summary will be appended to the Investigation summary.

==== `find` - Find items matching certain criteria

Format: `find ["<search string>"] [_type_]` +
Example: `find aspirin *-t*`

Display a list of all Impressions, Treatments and Evidence matching the criteria specified in the search.
If none of the `_type_` switches are used, all types of objects will be listed.
If at least one of them is listed, only objects whose type is used as a switch will be listed.

=== Treatment and Evidence [*v1.4*]

All Treatment and Evidence contexts (one for each type of Treatment and each type of Evidence) behave in essentially the same way: they display all their data in full.
This section will list the commands that they have in common.
Each individual Treatment and Evidence context is assumed to have all these commands, and all the commands in this inheritance list.

Inherits: <<home-help,`help`>>, <<patient-back,`back`>>, <<patient-up,`up`>>, <<patient-report,`report`>>, <<home-undo,`undo`>>, <<home-redo,`redo`>>

==== `edit` - Edit one of the details of the Treatment or Evidence

Format: `edit [-app[end]] <switch> [<new value>] [<switch> [<new value>]]`

The possible values for `<switch>` and `<new value>` can now be found in the <<type-table,table>> for `new` in the Impression context.

==== `move` - Move a Treatment or Evidence to a different Impression

Format: `move [-im[pression] "<search string>"]`

If a Treatment or Evidence is assigned incorrectly, it can be moved to a different Impression via this command.
If the `-im[pression]` switch is not used to specify the Impression to move it to, a window listing all Impressions will appear, and the user can select the correct Impression using its list index.

==== `priority` - Mark the Treatment or Evidence as a certain priority level

Format: `priority <new priority>`

`<new priority>` must be a non-negative integer.

=== Treatment [*v1.4*]

Contains everything in <<Treatment and Evidence>>.

==== `status` - Update the completion status of a Treatment

If no `<status name>` or `<status idx>` is specified, `status` will be incremented by 1, unless it is at the maximum value.

=== Investigation [*v1.4*]

Contains everything in <<Treatment and Evidence>>.

==== `result` - Convert the Investigation into a Result after completion

Format: `result -sum[mary] "<result summary>"`

The result summary will be appended to the Investigation summary.
