== Introduction

AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, AB3 is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (gui). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional gui apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
