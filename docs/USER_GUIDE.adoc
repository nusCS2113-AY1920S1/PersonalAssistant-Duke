== https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F11-1/main/blob/master/docs/README.adoc[Introduction]

Our desktop application SpongeBob, is a Command Line Interface (CLI)  based assistant which helps in managing the locker system of NUS SoC (School of Computing) Club. As of now, the club members use various generic platforms like Google Docs, Microsoft Excel, Outlook to manage the club’s locker and thus lack integration. SpongeBob tries to solve this problem by providing a “all-in-one” solution to manage the allocation of lockers, details of renters, changes to lockers at a location and zone, status of lockers and reminders on deadline of locker rental . Having an easy-to-use yet useful locker management system, we hope to make SpongeBob unique and optimized for SoC club.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `addLocker s/SERIALNUMBER`, `SERIALNUMBER` is a parameter which can be used as `addLocker s/1234`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [c/CONDITION]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/in-use` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME i/ID`, `I/ID n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* In case a token is used multiple times in a command then its last instance is taken eg. if the command entered is `n/NAME1 n/NAME2` then
the second instance of `n/NAME2` is considered.
* All commands are case insensitive e.g `help` or `HELP` or `HeLp` will display all the commands and their usage.
