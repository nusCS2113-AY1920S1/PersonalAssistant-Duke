== Product Name: Le Duc

---
== Overview
Le Duc is a task management product aiming to assist high school students manage their academic and extracurricular tasks, with the goal of increasing their time management/productivity. User/software interaction occurs on the command line, from which they have access to a variety of commands/operations.

== Contributions Summary
* *Major Enhancement*: *Added the ability to generate a reminder for upcoming tasks*
** What it does: Analyzes the user's tasklist, and will generate a reminder that highlights the top 3 upcoming tasks that are not yet complete.
** Justification: A user with a busy schedule could easily forget about a task that he/she must do. This feature will scan for upcoming tasks and remind the user of them, thus preventing the user from falling behind.
** Contributions: Search by day/week/month was implemented by Jérôme Huang
* *Major Enhancement*: *Created an advanced search feature*
** What it does: Uses an advanced string matching algorithm to search for tasks by descriptions, despite partial queries or query typos. Also allows the user to search for tasks by other metrics, such as completion, a date window, etc.
** Justification : The user may accidentally make a typo in their query, or make broad queries (search for tasks with certain keywords). An advanced search feature allows for this flexibility.

* *Major Enhancement*: *Generate Statistics from the Tasklist*
** What it does: Will analyze the tasklist and display interesting metrics to the user, such as % of tasks completed, the count of each type of task, etc. User can view detailed metrics regarding task priority/ completion via flags.
** Justification: This feature will help the user to make future decisions. For example, in the case when a large percentage of tasks are not complete, he/she might refrain from taking on an additional workload.
** Highlights: This enhancement will allow for interesting insights to be generated from the users schedule, most of which are not necessarily intuitive to see without aggregating all historical tasks over time.
* *Minor enhancement*: Created a homework task type..

== Contributions to the User Guide
Overview: I added user descriptions for my implemented features, and did general formatting/grammar adjustments document wide.

=== Find the task by keyword : `find`

To find a task by keyword : `find KEYWORD`

The find command allows the user to search for tasks by keyword.
The command will return a list of tasks, ordered by ascending relevancy.
Typos in the user query will not affect performance.

Examples:

* `find book`
* `find buy book`

=== Customize the welcome message : `setwelcome`

To customize the welcome message: `setwelcome WELCOME`

Example:

* setwelcome `hello World`

Be careful:

*Reverting to the previous welcome message is not possible once a new message is set.
*Ensure the directory data is in the correct location

=== Get some statistics: `stats`

Display statistics : `stats`

Example:

* `stats`

Output:

```
Here are some statistics about your task list:

Number of tasks: 13.0

Number of Todo's : 6.0

Number of Events: 2.0

Number of homeworks: 5.0

Number of Uncompleted Tasks: 13.0

Number of Completed Tasks: 0.0

Percent Complete: 0.0%
```

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

Overview: I have added the implementations of my features to the user guide : remind, statistics, and find. Our User Guide is https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T16-1/main/blob/master/docs/%5BAY1920S1-CS2113-T16-1%5D-%5BLe%20Duc%5D-UG.adoc#faq[here].

* *Implementation for remind:*


Display the 3 most upcoming unfinished tasks : `remind`

Tasks with associated timestamps are prioritized.
Non-timestamp tasks are pushed to the back of the filtered and chronologically sorted tasklist. Completed tasks are not displayed.

Helper Methods:

* `filterTasks` - Extracts the Homework and Event tasks into a seperate ArrayList
* `sort` - Orders the filtered TaskList in chronological order.

* *Sequence Diagram of the Remind Feature:*

image::RemindSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

There are 3 cases:

* TaskList contains a mix of all objects
* TaskList contains only Todo objects
* TaskList contains no objects

==== TaskList contains only homework/Event objects

* The original TaskList is passed through a filter.
* The filtered TaskList is equal to the original TaskList, as there are no Todo objects to filter out. The filtered TaskList will then be sorted by TakList.sort(). The method will call each tasks .getDate() and build a sorted ArrayList. All Todo's will be appended to the end of the sortedlist
* The first 3 most upcoming tasks will be displayed to the user.
* *Output:*

```---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
remind
1. [D][✗] d1 by: 14/09/2019 22:33 [Priority: 5]
2. [E][✗] e1 at: 21/09/2019 00:00 - 28/10/2019 22:22 [Priority: 5]
3. [T][✗] td1 [Priority: 5]
```
==== TaskList only contains Todo Objects

* The TaskList.sort() method will return the original list containing only Todo's. Todo tasks have no associated date, so the order in which they were created will be preserved. This is assuming that the order they were created by the user is the order of the intended completion.
* *Output:*
```---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
remind
1. [T][✗] todo1 [Priority: 5]
2. [T][✗] todo2 [Priority: 5]
3. [T][✗] todo3 [Priority: 5]
```
==== TaskList Contains No Objects

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There are no upcoming tasks in your list
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

==== Consideration
* Sorting the TaskList in place was considered, but it reduced cohesion of the design.
* It was considered to only remind the user of tasks that are coming up in the next week,
but that would limit its potential utility

* *Implementation for Find:*
To find a task by keyword: `find KEYWORD`

The find command allows the user to search for tasks by keyword.
The command will return a list of tasks, ordered by ascending relevancy.
Typos in the user query will not affect performance.

Backend uses a character comparison based algorithm called the "Sorensen-Dice" Fuzzy Matching algorithm. This algorithm generates "relevance scores" for each task in the tasklist. The tasklist is then filtered based on relevance scores, removing those with a score of 0.0. The filtered list is then displayed in order of relevance.
Example queries:

* `find book`
* `find buy book`

Sample Output:
```
find tesf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the matching tasks in your list:
8. [H][✗] test by: 01/01/2001 01:01 [Priority: 5]
7. [H][✓] science by: 05/05/2005 05:05 [Priority: 2]
1. [T][✗] td1 [Priority: 5]
3. [T][✓] td3 [Priority: 5]
4. [T][✗] td4 [Priority: 5]
5. [H][✗] math by: 11/11/2011 01:01 [Priority: 5]
6. [H][✓] homeworktest by: 04/04/2004 04:04 [Priority: 5]

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
* Note: The typo in the query "tesf" still returned the correct task as the most relevant match.
