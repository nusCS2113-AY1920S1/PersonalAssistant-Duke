## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **COMPal**!

**COMPal** is a Command Line Interface calendar application that targets students who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their busy student life. **COMPal** captures your timetable in a ***user-friendly layout***, giving you an ***informative overview*** of your schedule in a brief glance. 

Additionally, you can ***include non-academic activities*** along with your academic timetable, unlike other widely-used timetable tools. You also have the ***freedom to prioritise certain tasks*** over less important ones, and make use of ***timely reminders*** on pending tasks.

## 3. Quick Start
1. Ensure you have [**Java Version 11**](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase11-5116896.html) or above installed on your computer. 

2. Download the latest version of `COMPal.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W17-1/main/releases).

3. Copy the `COMPal.jar` file to the folder that you want to use as the home folder for **COMPal**.

4. Double-click the `COMPal.jar` file to start the application. The **COMPal** GUI should appear in a few seconds.

6. **COMPal** will then ask if you have entered your name correctly. If you have, then type `Yes` in the **command box** and press the `Enter` key. If not, please type `No` and press the `Enter` key, and **COMPal** will repeat **Step 5**.

7. And that's it! Initialisation is complete and **COMPal** just became your newest friend / most awesome assistant. You can now try entering commands in the **command box** and press `Enter` to execute it. 

8. Some example commands you can try:
    * `clear` : **clears** all output in the **output box**. Use this if the **output box** becomes too cluttered after typing too many commands.
    * `deadline <task description> /date <date of deadline>` : **adds** a task with a **deadline** 
    * `event <task description> /date <date of event> /time <time of event>` : **adds** an **event** that occurs at a specific time on a specific date
    * `find <search term>` : **find** a certain task related to a **search term**.
    * `list` : **displays the entire list of tasks** stored in **COMPal**'s massive memory. However, if you have just downloaded **COMPal**, it's likely that **COMPal** will not display any tasks. 
    * `bye` : **bid goodbye** to **COMPal** and exit the program. See you soon!!

This is the end of the **Quick Start** guide. Please refer to [4. Features](/docs/UserGuide.md#4-features) for more details on more commands. Enjoy planning your life with **COMPal**!
