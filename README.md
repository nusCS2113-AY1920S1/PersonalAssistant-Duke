**COMPal** is a Command Line Interface calendar application that targets students who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their busy student life. **COMPal** presents your timetable in a ***user-friendly layout*** that gives an ***informative overview*** of your schedule in just a brief glance. 

A student’s life is busy – being students ourselves, we understand the daily pressure of handling a million and one assignments, as well as factoring in time for our friends and loved ones. **COMPal** tackles that problem by allowing the ***inclusion of non-academic activities*** along with class timings, unlike other widely-used timetable tools. This makes it more convenient for you to find a ***balance*** between the ***work*** you ***have*** to do, and the ***people*** you ***care*** about.

In addition, **COMPal** offers you the ***freedom to prioritise certain tasks*** over others. Does a lecture timing clash with a pending meetup? Fret not! **COMPal** allows you to ***rank events according to importance***, so that you can adjust accordingly to any last-minute plans. Additionally, you can make use of ***timely reminders*** to keep track of any looming obligations.

**COMPal** relies on a Command Line Interface, perfect for the modern, fast-typing student. Take control. ***COMPal*** your life.
