## What is Eggventory?
For far too long the Faculty of Engineering's (FoE) lab technicians have had to deal with **convoluted and time-consuming** methods of tracking their inventory through **Excel sheets or even sometimes using pen and paper!**

*Worse still*, when it comes to loaning out items to students, items often go missing without any system to remind lab technicians to recollect items or renew loans.

The time spent on this administrative burden could be better spent on **continually improving lab facilities**, and even opening up the lab to more students to **support an improved culture of innovation** within FoE!

We hope to drive this change by creating an inventory management system that is **specialized and technical enough** to meet the requirements of lab technicians, while being **general enough to be used across multiple Engineering labs**.

## Why the name Eggventory?
<p align = "center"> <img src="./docs/assets/world_record_egg.png" alt="Majestic" height=50% width=50%> </p>

There are two reasons:
1. Eggventory stands for **Engineering Got General Inventory**. 
2. Our **philosophy of the Egg** at Team Eggventory.

*More on our philosophy:* At Eggventory we believe in the **power of the potential to be, and to do something greater**. Just as the unhatched egg cannot comprehend the infinite possibilities in the world outside until it is hatched, humans can be limited in their perspective and can often enclose their thinking within a box conforming to archaic and inefficient ideas of the past. 

**The Egg therefore serves as a reminder**, that unless we choose to move past our comfort zones and hatch into something greater, we will be unable to achieve **paradigmatic change**.

**It is this change that we at Eggventory strive towards timelessly.**

**Say goodbye to piles of paper records.** Eggventory allows you to quickly and conveniently view all your stock and loan records. With the colour-based status indicator, **hours spent slicing through inventory data can be cut down into seconds.** As students *we care* - you won't have to stay back after 5pm to account for our lab logistics anymore!
