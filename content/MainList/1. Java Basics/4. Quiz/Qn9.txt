An IDE generally consists of:

(1) A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.

(2) A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.

(3) A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.

(4) Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.

(5) All of the above | 5
