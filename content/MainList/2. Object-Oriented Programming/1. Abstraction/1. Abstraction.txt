Abstract Class
A class which contains the abstract keyword in its declaration is known as abstract class.

Abstract classes may or may not contain abstract methods, i.e., methods without body ( public void get(); )

But, if a class has at least one abstract method, then the class must be declared abstract.

If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated.

To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

If you inherit an abstract class, you have to provide implementations to all the abstract methods in it.
