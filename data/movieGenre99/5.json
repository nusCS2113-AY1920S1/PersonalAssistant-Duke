[[{"overview":"Filmmaker Michael Gramaglia's years-in-the-making biography of the legendary punk band the Ramones entitled End of the Century traces nearly all the various and sundry peaks and valleys which the seminal rockers experienced over the course of its 20-plus year career before disbanding in 1995. Beginning with the band's first concert performances in the mid-'70s, Gramaglia explores the eccentric and highly volatile band members -- in all the various line-ups that were presented over the years -- as the Ramones slowly gained fame for their high energy and high-tempo style of music that would later influence generations of punk rockers around the world. Mixing archival interviews with new interviews of the various surviving bandmembers, as well as interviews with a number of the Ramones' contemporaries, End of the Century encapsulates the East Coast underground music atmosphere of the 1970s and '80s that the band inadvertently shocked into existence.","original_language":"en","original_title":"End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones","video":false,"title":"End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones","genre_ids":[99,10402],"poster_path":"\/dPQFPkrpJcy6dpvBA4IBD1bWTOf.jpg","backdrop_path":"\/qnlOFRm8XsPVEjhl19evkQ3tegE.jpg","release_date":"2003-01-19","popularity":2.442,"vote_average":7.9,"id":16301,"adult":false,"vote_count":25},{"overview":"A look at how the community of Newtown, Connecticut came together in the aftermath of the largest mass shooting of schoolchildren in American history.","original_language":"en","original_title":"Newtown","video":false,"title":"Newtown","genre_ids":[99],"poster_path":"\/izPz20tr87N63RZIsSTeCgGYFSV.jpg","backdrop_path":"\/469qFUOMKyce1USVwdiy3busDXw.jpg","release_date":"2016-01-24","popularity":2.993,"vote_average":6.8,"id":376234,"adult":false,"vote_count":32},{"overview":"American soldiers of the 2\/3 Field Artillery, a group known as the \"Gunners,\" tell of their experiences in Baghdad during the Iraq War.
