JCW currently runs shows throughout the country. The video games Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This at Home and Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood feature numerous independent wrestlers from the promotion.\n\nThe style of JCW is largely based upon hardcore wrestling. Bruce and Utsler refer to Extreme Championship Wrestling as the major influence on the company's style as well as their unique camera angles, which they compare to that of the movie Natural Born Killers; \"fading in and out, and turning all over.\" In early years of the company, talent mostly consisted of rappers and well-known names performing under parody alternate-names. The company instituted a change in the roster after changing their name, focusing more on independent and hardcore wrestlers, as well as several established names.\n\nJCW records the majority of its shows and releases them in episodes of SlamTV! and on DVDs, which are sold on its online store. It launched the JCW Wrestling School with Kevin Canady as head trainer in 2010. That December, the promotion began running bi-weekly events at The Modern Exchange in Southgate, Michigan and established a video distributing partnership with HighSpots.com. In March 2011, it launched a broadcasting website and began showing its bi-weekly events live on internet pay-per-view.","original_name":"Juggalo Championship Wrestling","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Juggalo Championship Wrestling","cert":"Unavailable","id":6199,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":"1972-12-25","cast":["Iain Cuthbertson","Michael Bates","Jane Asher","Michael Bryant"],"overview":"The Stone Tape is a television play directed by Peter Sasdy and starring Michael Bryant, Jane Asher, Michael Bates and Iain Cuthbertson. It was broadcast on BBC Two as a Christmas ghost story in 1972. Combining aspects of science fiction and horror, the story concerns a team of scientists who move into their new research facility, a renovated Victorian mansion that has a reputation for being haunted. The team investigate the phenomena, trying to determine if the stones of the building are acting as a recording medium for past events. However, their investigations serve only to unleash a darker, more malevolent force.\n\nThe Stone Tape was written by Nigel Kneale, best known as the writer of Quatermass. Its juxtaposition of science and superstition is a frequent theme in Kneale's work; in particular, his 1952 radio play You Must Listen, about a haunted telephone line, is a notable antecedent of The Stone Tape. The play was also inspired by a visit Kneale had paid to the BBC's research and development department, which is located in an old Victorian house in Kingswood, Surrey. Critically acclaimed at time of broadcast, it remains well regarded to this day as one of Nigel Kneale's best and most terrifying plays. Since its broadcast, the hypothesis of residual haunting \u2013 that ghosts are recordings of past events made by the natural environment \u2013 has come to be known as the \"Stone Tape Theory\".","original_name":"The Stone Tape","vote_average":7.0,"name":"The Stone Tape","cert":"Unavailable","id":6214,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[18],"origin_country":["GB"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Our World was the first live, international, satellite television production, which was broadcast on 25 June 1967.

Their ability to communicate between each other in Danish, which is understood by no one else, also allows them certain freedom.\n\nAlong with the on-going challenge of getting their theatre show performed, the show also follows the three around certain \"tourist friendly\" landmarks in North Korea in or close to the capital Pyongyang, where they are taken to under strict supervision and guidance by officials.
