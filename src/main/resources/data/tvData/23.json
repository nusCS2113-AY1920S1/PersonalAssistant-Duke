Announcements also ran in much greater proportion than during prime time, with commercial breaks lasting longer; it was not uncommon for the second portion of the show to start at 12:05AM or 12:40AM.\n\nThe CBS Late Night block, however, was not always cleared by every affiliate of the network; in several markets, the block was either delayed by one hour than its regularly-scheduled time, picked-up by a local independent station, or not seen at all in certain cities. Those stations that did not carry CBS Late Night instead broadcast movies from their own libraries and\/or their own lineup of off-network syndicated sitcoms and dramas reruns and first-run syndication products. A large factor in the programming decisions of many CBS affiliates electing not to clear CBS Late Night was due to head-to-head competition with NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and later entering the 1980s, ABC News' Nightline.

The animated spots featured Timer, a tiny cartoon character who represented the sense of \"time\" in the human body. Timer was in charge of when a person felt it was time to eat, time to sleep, etc. He carried a large pocket watch inside of him, which would often set off an alarm whenever something was about to happen.\n\nUsually wearing a bow tie and top hat, Timer looked somewhat like a little yellow blob with long arms and legs, and a face. Timer also had limited magical powers, such as instant transportation, which he often used to exit his host body from time to time if things got too exhausting. A wise-cracker as well as a song-and-dance man, Timer promoted healthy eating and personal hygiene for children, using clever songs and animation.\n\nLike ABC's The Bod Squad series, the segments never carried official titles, but are referred to by memorable catch phrases in the songs' lyrics. Perhaps most memorable was \"I Hanker for a Hunk of Cheese\" in which Timer, recast as a cowboy with a thick Western accent, suggests \"wagon wheels,\" sandwiches made with cheese slices and crackers as an easy and nutritious snack.

This local children's show went on the air live in January 1957. Originally, the show was aired in an afternoon time slot from 5:00PM to 6:00PM, prior to Ralph Renick and the local news program. Popeye Playhouse had an audience of children who were primarily from Dade and Broward County Florida schools. Skipper Chuck announced the birthdays of children, and he and his co-hosts frequently did a \"Safety and Manners\" program at regional elementary schools.\n\nThe show moved to a videotape format sometime after 1958. Popeye Playhouse was then recorded at 4:00PM at the WTVJ Studios in downtown Miami, and broadcast the next weekday morning at 7:00AM. His show was radically impacted by the fact that Chuck was from the north. Born in Indiana, with radio and TV experience in Pennsylvania, he rejected the separation of the races on the program when he found out children were booked in groups from schools which were not integrated. Chuck demanded that management allow integration on his program. That happened in the late 1950s, and was prior to the 1960s when race relations became a national movement.","original_name":"Skipper Chuck","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Skipper Chuck","cert":"Unavailable","id":11381,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["US"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Shopaholic is a Norwegian television series first broadcast on TV3 in 2004.
