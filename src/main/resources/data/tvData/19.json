Secondly, it was the first television production where the camera was made into one of the 'characters' of the piece \u2013 the play revolves around the first-person perspective of the character whose viewpoint the camera represents, and who is not otherwise seen, his voice heard only in voiceover. The play ends with the main character faced with a firing squad.\n\nThe cast consisted of Reginald Brooke, Zoe Davies, Olga Edwardes, Wilfred Fletcher, Neil Porter, Hilary Pritchard, Henry Belling and Ben Soutten.\n\nTwenty minutes in length, the play was written by R.E.J. Brooke. It was produced by Jan Bussell and broadcast live from the BBC's studios at Alexandra Palace.
