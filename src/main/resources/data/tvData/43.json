It explains violent aspects of European settlement of Australia, such as killings, battles, wars, as well as acts of friendship and decency between the early European settlers and Indigenous Australians.

It was directed by David Morrissey from a script by Tony Marchant and stars James Nesbitt as Joe Keyes, a man who sees Alice, a young woman played by Emily Bruni, accosted by some men on a train one night. Alice looks to Joe for help but he ignores her predicament and gets off the train. A few days later, the police are seeking witnesses to a sexual assault against Alice. Joe unwillingly comes forward but, when giving evidence against the men in court, cannot bring himself to admit that he did nothing to save Alice.\n\nThe film was commissioned by the BBC's director of serials Laura Mackie at the outline stage. Marchant did not want to extend the script to any more than two parts because he thought two was the right length. He previously worked with Morrissey and producer David Snodin on the 1997 television series Holding On. The script went through five drafts; refinements included making Joe's wife less judgemental, and seeing other characters in the wider world reacting to Joe. It was filmed over 30 days.\n\nThe first part received 6.9 million viewers, and the second part 6.7 million. The second part was the first time BBC One won the 9\u201310 p.m. timeslot in two months.

I almost forgot: 'hello!' I sing and dance almost by myself - in the program Ma Pit'om.\". The show consisted of Kishkashta asking questions of himself as well as of the Israeli children who were his co-hosts.
