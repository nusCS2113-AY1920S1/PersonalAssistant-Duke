Created by brothers Lawrence and Charles Gordon, it was considered a modernized version of the classic 1960s sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. The series stars Richard Gilliland as a mild-mannered TV weatherman for KPOX-TV, and T. K. Carter as a hip, fun-loving 3,000-year-old genie who is freed by Gilliland after being imprisoned in his bottle for nearly two centuries.\n\nThe series was produced by Lorimar Productions, and initially promoted by ABC as one of its new ambitious comedies along with Webster. Just Our Luck was created to compete against The A-Team on NBC but earned low ratings for much of its run. It was poorly received by critics, however, and was the subject of controversy when the NAACP charged the show with promoting negative stereotypes of African-Americans. The NAACP originally campaigned to have the show removed but later settled for a degree of creative control in the show's development. This included changes to Carter's dialogue, the hiring of black staff writers and the addition of Leonard Simon to the cast.

One of the most popular and the longest-running weekly sports series in the history of New Zealand, the show featured some of the country's top wrestlers and international stars from throughout the world during the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nOn the Mat characterized the \"golden age\" of professional wrestling in New Zealand and made household names of promoter Steve Rickard, John da Silva, Robert Bruce and others during the 1970s. Much of the show's popularity was based on native New Zealanders and foreign wrestlers working together against their common enemies or, sometimes, being pitted against each other. Several New Zealand wrestlers such as Tony Garea, Peter Maivia, Siva Afi and The Sheepherders, partly from their television appearances, were brought over to the United States where they became major stars during the 1980s wrestling boom. Likewise, wrestlers from the National Wrestling Alliance, Stampede Wrestling, the World Wide Wrestling Federation and other foreign promotions were regulars on the show.","original_name":"On the Mat","vote_average":0.0,"name":"On the Mat","cert":"Unavailable","id":33356,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":["NZ"]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"House Party was a Canadian talk show television series which aired on CBC Television from 1954 to 1955.","original_name":"House Party","vote_average":0.0,"name":"House Party","cert":"Unavailable","id":33357,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"More Stories From Inside Quebec was a Canadian documentary television series which aired on CBC Television in 1967.","original_name":"More Stories From Inside Quebec","vote_average":0.0,"name":"More Stories From Inside Quebec","cert":"Unavailable","id":33366,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"Let's Speak English was a Canadian language instruction television series which aired on CBC Television from 1961 to 1962.","original_name":"Let's Speak English","vote_average":0.0,"name":"Let's Speak English","cert":"Unavailable","id":33367,"adult":"false","genre_ids":[],"origin_country":[]},{"first_air_date":null,"cast":[],"overview":"The Family Court is a Singaporean Chinese drama which was telecasted on Singapore's free-to-air channel, MediaCorp Channel 8.
